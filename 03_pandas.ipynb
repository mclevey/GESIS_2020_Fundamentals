    "This notebook introduces some fundamentals of scientific computing with `Pandas` and `matplotlib`. `Pandas` is an extremely popular Python package for storing, manipulating, and analyzing data in a tabular form, with rows and columns. We will learn how to get data into `pandas`, and then how to perform common data analysis tasks such as selecting columns, filtering rows, and computing descriptive statistics. Then we will learn how to use `matplotlib` for producing high-quality plots for print or the web. We will use it to create a variety of common statistical plots and other visualizations. \n",

    "Quantitative or computational social scientists are used to working with data in tabular form, such as a `dataframe` with variables in the columns and observations in the rows. In Python, the `Pandas` package enables us to organize, manipulate, and analyze data in this familiar way. \n",
    "\n",
    "`Pandas` is an extremely popular package in the scientific computing community regardless of the discipline (physics, sociology, neuroscience, history) or industry (academia, government, industry). It was originally developed for time series analysis. It gets it's name from **pan**el **da**ta. \n",
    "\n",
    "This part of the notebook covers some essential functionality of `Pandas` that you will make heavy use of in most data analyses. Of course, we will not cover *everything* that is possible to do with `Pandas`. As with the previous content, the goal is to build a basic foundation that we can build on throughout the week. We will emphasize the functionality that you take you the furthest in any give data analysis project. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Reading Data from Files \n",
    "\n",
    "`Pandas` makes it easy to load data from an external file directly into a `DataFrame`, which will discuss momentarily. It does so using one of many `reader` functions that are part of a suite of `I/O` (input / output, read / write) tools. For some common examples, see the table below. Information on these and other `reader` functions can be found in the `pandas` [documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html). The [documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html) also provides useful information about the parameters for these methods, such as how to specify what sheet you want from an Excel spreadsheet, or whether to write the index to a new `csv` file. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate how these `reader` functions work, we will use the `read_csv()` function. The only *required* argument is that we provide the path to the location of the file on our computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we will use the [\"Three Million Russian Trolls\" dataset](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-were-sharing-3-million-russian-troll-tweets/), which consists of data on ~3M tweets from Twitter accounts that are known to be part of state-sponsored disinformation campaigns. This particular dataset was collected and coded by Darrin Linvill and Patrick Warren, of Clemson University. It includes several variables that were hand coded by Linvill and Warren, the most important of which are classifications of accounts into different types. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is stored in 12 different `csv` files. They are stored in a directory called `russian-troll-tweets`, which is inside the `data` directory."

For example, you can't compute the mean and standard deviation of a collection of elements that include both integers and strings.

Like `numpy`, `pandas` is designed to make scientific computing more efficient, but as we will learn below there are some common pitfalls to avoid that, if you are not careful, can actually make working with `pandas` slow and inefficient. \n",

In a data analysis context, most of the row filtering you will do is likely to be based on some sort of explicit condition, such as \"give me all the observations with more than 1,000 followers.\" Most likely, you will only filter rows based on subsets if you are selecting the first $n$ rows of a `dataframe` that has been sorted by the values of some `series`. We will consider this case later. "

    "From [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/):\n",
    ">pandas is a **fast**, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is all true, with a pretty large caveat. Pandas is fast (and generally efficient), if you avoid some of the common pitfalls. Unfortunately, these traps are easy to fall for and many pandas users (even senior data scientists) don't know they might be slowing their code down 10-1000x. These people will often be hesitant to use pandas on large datasets and may dissuade others from using the library. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, by understanding a little about what is going on in the backend, we can avoid the worst of the problems and write relatively fast pandas code. \n",
