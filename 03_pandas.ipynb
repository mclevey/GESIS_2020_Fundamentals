    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces some fundamentals of scientific computing with `Pandas` and `matplotlib`. `Pandas` is an extremely popular Python package for storing, manipulating, and analyzing data in a tabular form, with rows and columns. We will learn how to get data into `pandas`, and then how to perform common data analysis tasks such as selecting columns, filtering rows, and computing descriptive statistics. Then we will learn how to use `matplotlib` for producing high-quality plots for print or the web. We will use it to create a variety of common statistical plots and other visualizations. \n",
    "\n",
    "As with yesterday, this notebook contains more information than we will likely be able to cover in a day. Depending on your experience, expertise, and research needs, we may jump around the notebook a bit to best \"meet you where you are.\" We hope that including a lot of narrative text will provide you with enough background to start working effectively with `pandas` in the context of real research projects. \n",

    "Quantitative or computational social scientists are used to working with data in tabular form, such as a `dataframe` with variables in the columns and observations in the rows. In Python, the `Pandas` package enables us to organize, manipulate, and analyze data in this familiar way. \n",
    "\n",
    "`Pandas` is an extremely popular package in the scientific computing community regardless of the discipline (physics, sociology, neuroscience, history) or industry (academia, government, industry). It was originally developed for time series analysis. It gets it's name from **pan**el **da**ta. \n",
    "\n",
    "This part of the notebook covers some essential functionality of `Pandas` that you will make heavy use of in most data analyses. Of course, we will not cover *everything* that is possible to do with `Pandas`. As with the previous content, the goal is to build a basic foundation that we can build on throughout the week. We will emphasize the functionality that can take you the furthest in any given data analysis project. \n",
    "\n",
    "# <i class=\"fa fa-location-arrow\"></i> READING DATA FROM FILES \n",
    "\n",
    "`Pandas` makes it easy to load data from an external file directly into a `DataFrame`, which will discuss momentarily. It does so using one of many `reader` functions that are part of a suite of `I/O` (input / output, read / write) tools. For some common examples, see the table below. Information on these and other `reader` functions can be found in the `pandas` [documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html). The [documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html) also provides useful information about the parameters for these methods, such as how to specify what sheet you want from an Excel spreadsheet, or whether to write the index to a new `csv` file. \n",

    "To illustrate how these `reader` functions work, we will use the `read_csv()` function. The only *required* argument is that we provide the path to the location of the file on our computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we will use the [\"Three Million Russian Trolls\" dataset](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-were-sharing-3-million-russian-troll-tweets/), which consists of data on ~3M tweets from Twitter accounts that are known to be part of state-sponsored disinformation campaigns. This particular dataset was collected and coded by Darrin Linvill and Patrick Warren, of Clemson University. It includes several variables that were hand coded by Linvill and Warren, the most important of which are classifications of accounts into different types. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is stored in 12 different `csv` files. They are stored in a directory called `russian-troll-tweets`, which is inside the `data` directory."

    "In this example, each element in `some_data` also contains information about the type of object it is. As previously mentioned, this is enormously helpful in some contexts, but dramatically slows down computation in other contexts. Data analysis is one example of where, depending on what you are trying to do, dynamic typing can slow things down rather a lot. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you are analyzing data, you are almost always working with some collection of elements that are all of the same type, such as integers, floats, strings, or Boolean values. For example, you can't compute the mean and standard deviation of a collection of elements that include both integers and strings. So it follows that data analysis can be made more efficient by working on data structures where information about data types is stored at the level of the collection itself rather than each element in the collection, *provided the data is all of the same type*. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main tools for doing this in `Python` is the `numpy` package, which is more or less the foundation of all data analysis in `Python`, whether you explicitly use it or not. `numpy` provides data structures for working with `arrays` of data that are a bit like lists except that all elements are of the same type, information about that type is stored at the level of the `array` itself, and each element in the `array` has an explicit integer index. `arrays` can be one dimensional vectors or multi-dimensional matrices. \n",
    "\n",
    "Further discussion of `numpy` is beyond the scope of this class. For our purposes here, what you need to know is that `pandas` builds on top of `numpy` and offers an additional set of data structures and methods that are designed explicitly to meet the needs to researchers working with real-world empirical data. Like `numpy`, `pandas` is designed to make scientific computing more efficient, but as we will learn below there are some common pitfalls to avoid that, if you are not careful, can actually make working with `pandas` slow and inefficient.

    "\n",
    "From [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/):\n",
    ">pandas is a **fast**, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is all true, with a pretty large caveat. Pandas is fast (and generally efficient), if you avoid some of the common pitfalls. Unfortunately, these traps are easy to fall for and many pandas users (even senior data scientists) don't know they might be slowing their code down 10-1000x. These people will often be hesitant to use pandas on large datasets and may dissuade others from using the library. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, by understanding a little about what is going on in the backend, we can avoid the worst of the problems and write relatively fast pandas code. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### How are DataFrames stored? \n",
    "\n",
    "DataFrames are really just a collection of `Series`, with each column corresponding to its own `Series`. In a `Series`, each item is stored one after the other in memory. This means that the entire column is stored within a single range of memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the multiple Series (columns) that make a DataFrame can be stored anywhere in memory and are often not stored side-by-side. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of this like a grocery list for sandwiches. Lets imagine that each kind of sandwich we make is composed of 1 type of bread, 1 type of  meat and 1 type of vegetable. We could arrange our grocery list into a table like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "| sandwich_id | bread_type | meat_type  | vegetable_type |\n",

    "Combining datasets is one of the most valuable skills you can have for doing data analytics. In general this process is referred to as \"Data Integration\" or \"Record Linkage\". \n",
    "\n",
    "The `merge` function works great when you can make _exact_ matches between columns. It also works really well because checking for exact matches has been optimized in Pandas. However, its often the case that we need to combine datasets which cannot be merged based on exact matches. \n",

    "Instead, we often have to use **inexact matching** (aka fuzzy matching or approximate matching) to combine datasets. Typically, this involves using some similarity metric to how close two keys are to one another. Then a match is made based on thresholds, rules, or a nearest-neighbour approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, naively calculating similarity between all possible key combinations results in incredibly lengthy compute times. Instead, there are ways to exclude some key pairs from the beginning. This allows you to drastically reduce the number of comparisons you need to make. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, inexact matching can leverage machine learning techniques which uses human curated examples to learn to predict whether two rows should be matched with one another. \n",
    "\n",
