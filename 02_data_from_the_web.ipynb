    "Regardless of whether you are going to collect your data by web scraping or by making calls to a well-documented API, you need to have a basic understanding of how the web works to get the data you want. We have provided a draft chapter of *Doing Computational Social Science* on collecting data from the web that offers a high-level explanation of what happens when your computer makes a request to a remote web server. If you are unfamiliar with the concepts of Internet protocols, IP addresses, Domain Name Server, `GET` requests, and so on, we suggest you review that chapter. "

    "## Essential HTML\n",
    "\n",
    "When your computer receives an HTML page from a web server, it creates something called a Document Object Model (DOM) and stores it in memory. Your web browser then renders the page on your screen. To scrape the web effectively, you need to understand the DOM and some basics of how documents are structured using HTML and styled using CSS.\n",
    "\n",
    "As someone who frequently reads and writes \"documents\" (news stories, blog posts, journal articles, Tweets, etc.), you are already familiar with the basics of structuring and organizing documents using headings, subheadings, and so on. As humans, we parse these organizational features of documents *visually*, using size, color, types of font, bullets, and so on. If you create a document using a WYSIWYG (What you see is what you get) program like a word processor, you apply different styles to parts of the text to indicate whether something is a title, a heading, a paragraph, a list, etc. HTML documents also have these organizational features, but use special 'markup' to tell a computer how to render them to a reader. Best practice is to use html to describe structural features of a document and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to describe how things should appear. Content, structure, and style are separate. \n",
    "\n",
    "HTML markup consists of 'elements' (e.g. paragraphs) with opening and closing tags. You can think of these tags as containers. The tags tell your browser about the text that sits between the opening and closing tags (or \"inside the container\"). For example, the `paragraph` element opens a paragraph with `<p>` and closes it with `</p>`. The actual text content of the paragraph -- which is what you see and read in your browser -- lives between those tags.\n",
    "\n",
    "The outermost element in any HTML document is `html`. Your computer knows that anything between `<html>` and `</html>` tags should be processed as HTML markup. Most of the time, the next element in an HTML page will be a `head` element. The text inside the `<head>` and `</head>` tags will not actually be rendered by your browser. Instead, they contain metadata and other text about the page itself. This is where the page title is contained, which is displayed on the tab in your browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the HTML tags, will also find a `body` element. Anything inside the `<body>` and `</body>` tags will be displayed in the main browser window (e.g. the text of a news story). Inside the body tags, you will typically find elements for headings (e.g. `<h1>` and `</h1>`, `<h2>` and `</h2>`, and so on), paragraphs (`<p>` and `</p>`), bold text (`<strong>` and `</strong>` or `<b>` and `</b>`), italicized text (`<i>` and `</i>` or `<em>` and `</em>`), as well as ordered and unordered lists, tables, images, links, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes elements include 'attributes,' which provide more information about the content of the text. For example, a paragraph element may specify that the text contained within it's tags are American English. This information is contained inside the opening bracket. `<p lang=\"en-us\">American English sentence here...</p>`. As you will soon learn, attributes can be *extremely* useful when scraping the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before moving on, it is important to understand one final type of HTML element you will frequently encounter when developing web scrapers: the division tag `div`. This is simply a generic container that splits a website into smaller sections. Developers often use them to apply a particular style (e.g. switch to a `monospaced` font} to display code) to some chunk of text in the HTML document using CSS. Splitting webpages into these smaller pieces using `div` tags makes websites easier for developers to maintain and modify. They also make it easier for us web scrapers to drill down and grab the information we need. You will see this in action in the examples to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "When scraping the web you will also encounter CSS, which as I previously mentioned is used to *style* websites. To properly understand how CSS works, remember that the vast majority of modern websites are designed to separate content (e.g. actual words that mean things to humans) from structure and style. HTML markup tells your browser what some piece of text is (e.g. a heading, a list item, a row in a table, a paragraph) and CSS tells your browser what it should look like when rendered in your browser (e.g. what font to use for subheadings, how big to make the text, what colour to make the text, and so on). If there is no CSS, then your browser will use an extremely minimal default style to render the text in your browser. In most cases, developing a good web scraper will require a deeper understanding of HTML than CSS, so we will set aside a further discussion of CSS for now. \n",
    "\n",
    "A full inventory of HTML and CSS elements is, of course, beyond the scope of this course. The good news is that you do not need exhaustive knowledge of either to write a good web scraper. To put it another way, you need to know much less HTML and CSS to effectively scrape a website than you do to develop that same website. You need to have a basic understanding of the key concepts and you need to know what the most common tags mean, but *more than anything else* you need to be willing to spend time investigating the source code for websites you want to scrape, attempt to solve problems creatively, and work interatively. We will turn to those tasks next.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Inspecting Source\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, the process of requesting and rendering a page is handled by our browser (remember to consult the draft chapter if you are uncertain about this process), but as you probably realize, this is not the only way to request HTML documents from a web server. We can also connect to a web server from a Python script using a package like `requests`, and we can load the HTML provided by the web server into our computer's memory. Once we have this HTML in memory (rather than rendered in a browser), we can move onto the next step, which is to start parsing the HTML and extracting the information we want. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we load an HTML document in Python, we are looking at the raw markup, not the rendered version we see when we load that file in a browser. If we print the HTML to screen (as we will later), we will see all of the markup the browser hides when it renders a page. If we are lucky, the information we want will be consistently stored in elements that are easy to grab and which do not contain a lot of irrelevant information. In order to get that information, we need to parse the HTML file. We can do this using a Python package called `BeautifulSoup`. To use `BeautifulSoup` effectively, we have to study the HTML code for the website we want to scrape.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to study the source code of a website for the purposes of developing a web scraper is to use the developer tools built into modern web browsers. Let's see what this looks like. "

    "Once the story is loaded, we can right-click and select \"Inspect Element\" to open a pane of developer tools. (You can also open this pane by selecting \"Toggle Tools\" from the \"Web Developer\" section of the \"Tools\" menu in the toolbar.) We can use these tools to study our target webpage interactively. We can view the rendered content and the raw source code of the webpage simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "One especially useful strategy is to highlight some information of interest on the webpage and then right-click and select \"Inspect Source\" (even if the developer tools pane is already open). This will jump to that specific highlighted information in the HTML code, making it much easier to quickly find what tags the information you need is stored in. From here, we can strategize how best to retrieve the data we want. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is an *iterative* process. As we develop our web scraper, we progressively narrow down to the information we need, clean it by stripping out unwanted information (e.g. white spaces, new line characters), and then write it to some sort of dataset for later use. \n",
    "\n",
    "Scraping text from a static page is *generally* a pretty straightforward task, since you can be more or less confident that most of the content you want will be stored in headers (`<h1>...</h1>`, `<h2>...</h2>`) and paragraph tags (`<p>...</p>`). Other information can, of course, be extracted with a bit of detective work.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the code block below, we import the two packages we will use, get the HTML, construct the soup object using an `lxml` parser, and then -- *just because we can* -- print the raw HTML DOM to our screen. "

Yes, he has precious little room for manoeuvre and he’s soon going to run into reality; he’ll have to reach an accommodation, find something he can present as a victory.”\n",

      "       <p>\n",
      "        But his very presence in No 10 showed Johnson was not the bumbler the continental media like to portray him as, Gattolin said, adding: “He pretends he’s a bull in a china shop – but he knew how to get in, by the front door.

Martin Ehl’s 15-minute interview in November 2016 with the then foreign secretary won him brief international fame after Johnson was quoted dismissing as “bollocks” the notion that freedom of movement was a fundamental EU value.\n",

      "        Ehl said Johnson was “a politician and he does what he thinks is best for him”. Ehl said he had no problem with that, “but I do have a problem with someone trying to undermine our honesty and dignity … I saw in him a professional politician who knew he was talking to a journalist and that he had to say something that would resonate and make a good headline. But he wasn’t so careful.”\n",

      "       <p>\n",
      "        Pascal Boniface, the director of the French Institute for International and Strategic Affairs, agreed it was as much of a mistake for the French to mock Johnson as it was for them to laugh at Donald Trump. “We sit here jeering at them, and meanwhile they get on with putting their plans into action,” he said.\n",
      "       </p>\n",
      "       <p>\n",
      "        There were clearly similarities between the two leaders, Boniface said: both lead from the front, taking few hostages; both are opportunists, guided more by public opinion than any fixed ideology. But as far as Europe was concerned, he added, Johnson’s biggest problem was that the UK is not the US.\n",

      "        “The European reflex is still to show some deference to the US,” he said. “But the EU27 will not scrap the deal for Britain. The shock of reality will be brutal for Johnson – he may conceivably frighten Conservative MPs into backing him in parliament, but he won’t budge the EU.”\n",

      "        Italy’s former state secretary for European affairs Sandro Gozi now a Europe adviser to the French government, said Johnson was “a man who has changed his mind about quite a lot of things”, but had been “utterly consistent on Europe as prime minister: Britain must leave on 31 October. Well, we must respect that – but the question is, how will Britain leave? We await his proposal. The ball is in his court. A hard\n",

      "        Reality is waiting in the wings, agreed Salvatore Margiotta, an MP with the Democratic party. Johnson is “a poker player who will now have to reveal his bluff”, he said. “We are facing a farce, a sort of Brexit fake. A no deal would have dramatic consequences, especially for the UK – and Johnson, who is prejudiced but not foolish, knows this.”\n",
      "       </p>\n",
      "       <p>\n",
      "        Ulrike Herrmann, economics commentator for the leftwing German daily Taz, concurred. It would be “intriguing to see when and how Boris Johnson effects his about-turn. Because he has a pragmatic relationship to power,” she said. “He became PM by posing as a hardliner. Long-term, though, he can only stay in this office if he says goodbye to a hard Brexit.”\n",

      "       <p>\n",
      "        Gabriel Felbermayr, the president of the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, suggested it would soon become clear whether Johnson really had a plan, but “with his provocative style, he is certainly not the person to build a bridge between his country, at odds with itself, and Brussels”.\n",
      "       </p>\n",
      "       <p>\n",
      "        Markus Becker, Spiegel’s Brussels correspondent, wondered whether Johnson was “simply going to let it come to no deal – in the hope that he will, as usual, be able to withdraw himself from the affair with a mix of chutzpah, charm and luck, and then pass the blame for the mess on to someone else”.\n",
      "       </p>\n",
      "       <p>\n",
      "        Bild’s lead opinion writer, Franz Josef Wagner, said Johnson had sprung from Britain’s “black and quirky” sense of humour: Mr Bean, Monty Python, anti-German jokes. “When things are bad in England, people laugh rather than complain about it,” he said. “I only hope they can continue to laugh under Boris Johnson.”\n",
      "       </p>\n",
      "       <p>\n",
      "        Some certainly doubt that. The Nobel literature laureate Mario Vargas Llosa, who lives in Spain, recently called Boris Johnson “a liar and a clown” and warned that he posed a threat to “Britain’s progress, civilisation and culture”.\n",
      "       </p>\n",
      "       <p>\n",
      "        But Carles Casajuana, who was Spain’s ambassador to the UK between 2008 and 2012 and met Johnson when he was mayor of London, recalled a “very intelligent, very nice” person. That was hidden, though, he said, behind an “air of frivolity: deep down, I think he’s much more calculating than he wants to show.”\n",
      "       </p>\n",
      "       <p>\n",
      "        Berta Herrero, a journalist specialising in the EU, said Spaniards tended to see Johnson as “kind of kamikaze”, and very loose on the facts. “He’s seen as reckless; as someone who has built a career on lying and convincing people of what’s on his mind: of his fantasies, not necessarily of the truth or the facts,” she said. “He is trying to copy Trump, but is more like his little brother.”\n",

This JavaScript is executed *by your computer, not by the remote server.* It changes what is displayed, which poses additional challenges for web scrapers. A discussion of scraping websites with a lot of JavaScript is beyond the scope of this course, but we it here because you are likely to encounter at least some JavaScript in any serious web scrape.

    "Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) offer an alternative way to access data from online sources. They provide an explicit _interface_ to the data behind the website, defining how you can request data and what format you will receive the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components of API Requests & Responses\n",
    "**Endpoints** are the specific web locations where a request for a particular resource can be sent. Usually they have descriptive names like Content, Tweet, User, etc. We communicate with APIs by sending requests to these endpoints, usually in the form of a URL. \n",
    "\n",
    "These URLs usually contain optional **queries**, **parameters**, and **filters** that let us specify exactly what we want the API to return. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once a request has been made to the API it is going to return a **response**. Every response will have a response code, which will indicate whether the request was successful (200) or encountered an error (400, 401, 500, etc.). When you encounter a problem its a good idea to confirm you received a successful response, instead of one of the [many error responses](https://documentation.commvault.com/commvault/v11/article?p=45599.htm). \n",
    "\n",

    "### Overview\n",
    "The Guardian's API allows us to query and download data related to their published articles. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Guardian API has five **endpoints**: \n",
    "* Content (`https://content.guardianapis.com/search`) &mdash; returns content. For dev keys only text. Allows querying and filtering to reduce what is returned.  \n",
    "* Tags &mdash; will return all API tags (> 50, 000). These tags can be used in other quries. \n",
    "* Sections &mdash; logical grouping of content\n",
    "* Editions &mdash; the content for each of the three regional main pages\n",
    "* Single Item &mdash; will return all data related to a specific item (content, tag, or section) in the API. \n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we will focus on the content endpoint. This will allow us to retrieve the body text and metadata for articles published in The Guardian.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, the easiest way to interface with an API is through a client. In Python, these clients are just packages that provide functions to simplify the process of accessing the API. \n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, we can access APIs directly using the [`requests`](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/) library. By accessing the API directly, we maintain freedom in how we use the API, rather than be restricted to a client. This is the option we will choose for interfacing with The Guardian API. \n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='g_key'></a>\n",
    "### API Key\n",
    "Hopefully you were all successful in receiving a Guardian API Key. If not please let one of us know! \n",
    "\n",
    "This API key is what gives you access to the Guardian API. Its kind of like a username and password, all wrapped into one. It is how the API monitors who is accessing their site and makes sure they are abiding by the proper terms of service.\n",
    "\n",
    "We all registered for a developer key. With this key we receive:  \n",
    "* Up to 12 calls per second\n",
    "* Up to 5,000 calls per day\n",
    "* Access to article text (no image, audio, or video)\n",
    "* Access to a subset of Guardian content (1.9 million pieces)\n",
    "\n",
    "If we had registered (and paid) for a commercial key, we would have fewer limitations in what we can access from the API. \n",
    "\n",
    "As I mentioned earlier, you can think of your API token as your username and password for accessing The Guardian API. Like any other credentials, we want to make sure this is kept secure. Most importantly, **never share API tokens in public locations**, including in git repositories or emails. \n",
    "\n",
    "Making an API token public allows others to access the API as if they were you. This puts you at risk if they violate the terms of service you agreed to when you requested an API token. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if someone were to get ahold of your API token, they could use it to launch a [denial of service attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack) on The Guardian's API. In this case, your token may be revoked and you'd be unable to request a new API token in the future without further violating the terms and services. \n",
    "\n",
    "To mitigate against this problem I would recommend one of two options: \n",
    "* Storing API tokens as environment variables\n",
    "* Creating a `cred.py` to store credentials such as API tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "Personally, I use a `cred.py` containing any of the credentials I need to access APIs, databases, etc. I keep this file stored on my computer in a single location which can be accessed by any Python script on my machine (usually somewhere in `PATH`). This way, the API token is outside of a script I might share and the file is outside of a git repo I might make public one day. \n",
    "\n",
    "If for some reason you need to store the `cred.py` file in the same directory as your Python file and this is within your git repo, make sure to add `cred.py` to the `.gitignore` file.\n",
    "\n",

    "Twitter has multiple APIs that are available to developers and researchers. The `REST API` can be used to collect information about user accounts and a limited number of historical tweets. For example, you could use the `REST API` to find out information about the account belonging to sociologist Mario Small, such as his Twitter ID number, the description he uses in his bio, the number of followers he has, the number of friends he follows, and who his followers and friends are. In addition to this information, you can collect the text and tweet metadata for his most recent 3,200 tweets. \n",
    "\n",
    "Twitter imposes rate limits on access to the REST API, which means that it can be rather slow to collect certain kinds of information, such as information about followers and friends. More specifically, Twitter restricts users to making 15 requests per 15 minutes. The amount of information you can get with each request depends on what exactly you are asking for, which can be a bit confusing when you first start using this API. If you make more requests than permitted within a 15 minute window, Twitter will break your connection to the REST API. However, (1) `Tweepy` simplifies the work needed to stay within the rate limits and avoid disconnection, and (2) you can collect substantially more data per request if you use Twitter's ID numbers rather than screen names. \n",
    "\n",
    "Twitter also offers a `Streaming API`, which enables you to download tweets in real time. Unlike the `REST API` which *pulls* historical data from Twitter, the Streaming API *pushes* real time data to us. We receive that data using a `StreamListener` class, which we will discuss shortly. This enables us to collect an enormous amount of data in a short amount of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The free version of the Streaming API enables you to collect up to 1% of all tweets produced within 10 milliseconds of your request. If you are looking to use this method to collect a dataset of tweets that are representative of the Twitterverse at any given moment, there are plenty of reasons to be skeptical, the main reason being that Twitter does not disclose how it selects the 1% sample. However, if you are collecting tweets within a specific set of search parameters (e.g. filtered to tweets produced by a list of user accounts, within a geographic region, or containing some specific keyword), then it is possible to collect *all* relevant tweets. This only works if the tweets produced within your search parameters are less than 1% of all tweets posted within 10 milliseconds. Given how massive Twitter is and how much data it's users produce, chances are you can stay under 1% and collect all tweets that are relevant to whatever your research question is."

    "Many tweets contain links to other tweets, and to content external to Twitter. There is potentially a lot of interesting and useful information that we can gather from these links, but we have to do some extra work to get it. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to identify links in the tweets themselves. There are a number of ways to do this, including using a regular expression (which we do in one of the custom functions below). The resulting links have been shortened by Twitter (e.g. [https://t.co/RmUDsFf3em](https://t.co/RmUDsFf3em). In order to know what content a Tweet is linking to, we need to tell Python to follow the link. This will trigger a redirect to the linked content. We can then tell Python to tell us what the *actual* link is. Finally, we can use a package like `tldextract` to parse the actual link and return the top-level domain (e.g. Twitter, the New York Times, etc.). \n",
