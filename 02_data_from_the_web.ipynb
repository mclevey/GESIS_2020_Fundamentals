    "## Understanding APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) offer an alternative way to access data from online sources. They provide an explicit _interface_ to the data behind the website, defining how you can request data and what format you will receive the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components of API Requests & Responses\n",
    "**Endpoints** are the specific web locations where a request for a particular resource can be sent. Usually they have descriptive names like Content, Tweet, User, etc. We communicate with APIs by sending requests to these endpoints, usually in the form of a URL. \n",
    "\n",
    "These URLs usually contain optional **queries**, **parameters**, and **filters** that let us specify exactly what we want the API to return. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once a request has been made to the API it is going to return a **response**. Every response will have a response code, which will indicate whether the request was successful (200) or encountered an error (400, 401, 500, etc.). When you encounter a problem its a good idea to confirm you received a successful response, instead of one of the [many error responses](https://documentation.commvault.com/commvault/v11/article?p=45599.htm). \n",
    "\n",
    "As long as a request was successful, it will return a 200 OK response along with all the requested data. We will delve into what this data looks like below. \n",
    "\n",
    "### APIs vs Web Scraping \n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits: \n",
    "* Structured data (for the most part). \n",
    "* Controlled by an organization or company (Guardian, Twitter, etc) \n",
    "* Documented (usually)\n",
    "* Maintained (usually)\n",
    "* Rules for access are explicitly stated\n",
    "\n",
    "Drawbacks: \n",
    "* Limited to the data made explicitly available\n",
    "* Relies on the organization to make updates\n",
    "* Rate limits & other restrictions apply and are usually based on business reasons rather than technical limitations\n"

    "## The Guardian API\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='g_overview'></a>\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "The Guardian's API allows us to query and download data related to their published articles. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Guardian API has five **endpoints**: \n",
    "* Content (`https://content.guardianapis.com/search`) &mdash; returns content. For dev keys only text. Allows querying and filtering to reduce what is returned.  \n",
    "* Tags &mdash; will return all API tags (> 50, 000). These tags can be used in other quries. \n",
    "* Sections &mdash; logical grouping of content\n",
    "* Editions &mdash; the content for each of the three regional main pages\n",
    "* Single Item &mdash; will return all data related to a specific item (content, tag, or section) in the API. \n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we will focus on the content endpoint. This will allow us to retrieve the body text and metadata for articles published in The Guardian.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, the easiest way to interface with an API is through a client. In Python, these clients are just packages that provide functions to simplify the process of accessing the API. \n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, we can access APIs directly using the [`requests`](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/) library. By accessing the API directly, we maintain freedom in how we use the API, rather than be restricted to a client. This is the option we will choose for interfacing with The Guardian API. \n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='g_key'></a>\n",
    "### API Key\n",
    "Hopefully you were all successful in receiving a Guardian API Key. If not please let one of us know! \n",
    "\n",
    "This API key is what gives you access to the Guardian API. Its kind of like a username and password, all wrapped into one. It is how the API monitors who is accessing their site and makes sure they are abiding by the proper terms of service.\n",
    "\n",
    "We all registered for a developer key. With this key we receive:  \n",
    "* Up to 12 calls per second\n",
    "* Up to 5,000 calls per day\n",
    "* Access to article text (no image, audio, or video)\n",
    "* Access to a subset of Guardian content (1.9 million pieces)\n",
    "\n",
    "If we had registered (and paid) for a commercial key, we would have fewer limitations in what we can access from the API. \n",
    "\n",
    "As I mentioned earlier, you can think of your API token as your username and password for accessing The Guardian API. Like any other credentials, we want to make sure this is kept secure. Most importantly, **never share API tokens in public locations**, including in git repositories or emails. \n",
    "\n",
    "Making an API token public allows others to access the API as if they were you. This puts you at risk if they violate the terms of service you agreed to when you requested an API token. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if someone were to get ahold of your API token, they could use it to launch a [denial of service attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack) on The Guardian's API. In this case, your token may be revoked and you'd be unable to request a new API token in the future without further violating the terms and services. \n",
    "\n",
    "To mitigate against this problem I would recommend one of two options: \n",
    "* Storing API tokens as environment variables\n",
    "* Creating a `cred.py` to store credentials such as API tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "Personally, I use a `cred.py` containing any of the credentials I need to access APIs, databases, etc. I keep this file stored on my computer in a single location which can be accessed by any Python script on my machine (usually somewhere in `PATH`). This way, the API token is outside of a script I might share and the file is outside of a git repo I might make public one day. \n",
    "\n",
    "If for some reason you need to store the `cred.py` file in the same directory as your Python file and this is within your git repo, make sure to add `cred.py` to the `.gitignore` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go ahead and create this `cred.py` file now.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Back on the Jupyter Home Page, click on the New button on the upper right side & select the text option (see the screenshot below). \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=img/new_file.png></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "A new file will open. Rename it cred.py and add the following line, replacing `<YOUR_TOKEN>` with your own API token.  \n",
    "\n",
    "```python3\n",
    "guardian_key = <YOUR_TOKEN>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Save & exit the file.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Run the cell below. If it runs without throwing any errors, the API token has been successfully saved."

       "    'body': '<p>1) It’s the Prix de l’arc Triomphe on Sunday so let’s get ourselves in the mood with a highlights reel: Enable will be going for a historic hat-trick at Longchamp so watch her <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZnoEb3V40M\">win in 2017</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3Mho_bpjY8\">repeat the feat</a> last year. Here’s some footage from the vaults of<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXM-Nrnph_Q\"> Seabird triumphing in 1965</a>, Sea the Stars <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PXg8nUK3Rs\">pulling clear and holding on</a> during his all-conquering year in 2009, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy1U6zBlmK0\">Dancing Brave in 1986</a>, with Pat Eddery on board, the jockey claiming the second of three consecutive Arc wins.</p> <p>2) Trust the Orioles’ Stevie Wilkerson to leave the catch of the season until the last game of the MLB season, against the Red Sox at Fenway Park. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vflIWak3BKQ\">It’s quite something</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vflIWak3BKQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vflIWak3BKQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>3) Tottenham can take a just a shred of comfort from the fact that their 7-2 home defeat by Bayern Munich is not actually their worst hammering in Europe. That sorry record is owned by the class of 1995, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeiBT-GLS0w\">who lost 8-0 at Cologne in the Intertoto Cup</a>. To be fair to manager Gerry Francis, though, he fielded a squad of loan players and reserves. “We had no players,” said Francis. “We were all looking at players just to see if we could get a team out that was the best standard we could manage. We got some sort of permission to bring players in. Alan Pardew was one of them.” Ah.</p> <p>4) Track action at the World Athletics Championships concludes this weekend, as is traditional, with relay finals, so let’s spin back to some classic races of yesteryear. Here’s the American 4x100m quartet of Emmit King, Willie Gault, Calvin Smith and Carl Lewis <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gub8a4OSXdg\">setting a then-world record in Helsinki</a> 36 years ago. Lewis was anchored the USA’s world record-breaking team <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AAA8DOC5rc\">at the 1991 championships in Tokyo</a>. But the American hold on the mark was shattered with Jamaica’s emergence – the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByUC0mEUVMk\">team of Steve Mullings, Michael Frater, Usain Bolt and Asafa Powell</a> in 2009, and again two years later <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCb78C1rLjc\">when Bolt led them home</a> alongside Nesta Carter, Frater again and Yohan Blake.</p> <p>Here’s another triumphant Jamaican performance, from Beijing 2015, when Veronica Campbell-Brown, Natasha Morrison, Elaine Thompson and the all-conquering Shelly-Anne Fraser-Price <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvrCnKX4wP4\">stormed home in championship record time</a>.

       "    'body': '<p>The dramatic life and times of the Formula One racing champion Michael Schumacher are to be released as a feature-length film documentary described as a personal tribute to him by his family and friends.</p> <p>Schumacher will tell the story of the star, from his boyhood days as a hobby go-karter in Kerpen near Cologne, to his legendary victories on the race track where he secured seven Formula One titles. It will also document the near-fatal skiing accident five years ago that left him with devastating head injuries from which he is still recovering.</p> <p>The film is due for release in German and Swiss cinemas on 5 December, while the foreign licence rights – including streaming service access – will be up for grabs at the upcoming Cannes film festival, when the film’s trailer will be shown publicly for the first time. It is likely to compete for attention alongside Maradona, a documentary portrait of the legendary Argentinian footballer Diego Maradona, the screening of which he will attend.</p> <p>Unlike previous film portraits of Schumacher, the making of the film by the Hamburg production house BI 14 Film has received the full backing of his family, including his wife of 24 years, Corinna, and the couple’s two children, Gina, 22, and Mick, 20, both of whom have won sporting accolades, for western horse riding and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/mar/25/michael-schumacher-son-mick-f1-debut-ferrari\">Formula 2 racing</a> respectively.</p> <p>They are reported by the German media to have worked closely alongside the award-winning film makers Michael Wech and Hanns-Bruno Kammertöns and are all interviewed in the film, as is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/may/09/mick-schumacher-father-greatest-inspiration-f1-spanish-grand-prix\">Schumacher’s 73-year-old father, R</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/may/09/mick-schumacher-father-greatest-inspiration-f1-spanish-grand-prix\">olf</a>. Footage from the family archives that has never been seen publicly before, including scenes of Schumacher at home with the family, will also be included.</p> <p>Scenes from Schumacher’s 50th birthday celebrations in January are expected to be included in the film, which will also celebrate the 25th anniversary of his first World Championship success, when he raced to victory over his main rival Damon Hill in Adelaide, Australia, after the two crashed spectacularly.</p> <p>But the documentary is believed not to reveal the true state of Schumacher’s health and neither is it believed he will speak on camera. His skiing accident in the French resort of Meribel on 29 December 2013, a little over a year after his retirement from motor racing, almost cost him his life and left him in a coma after he crashed into a rock and suffered a traumatic brain injury, despite wearing a helmet. He spent six months being treated in hospital in Grenoble before being allowed home to start an extensive rehabilitation process.</p> <p>He is said to remain dependent on a team of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/02/michael-schumacher-best-of-hands-family-f1-great-formula-one\">doctors and carers</a> at his home in Gland, Switzerland, but the family has never made any comment on the state of his health.</p> <p>Schumacher is reported to receive regular visitors and is believed to have been flown by helicopter accompanied by his carers to the Spanish island of Mallorca, where the family owns a villa, to spend his 50th birthday. </p>',\n",

       "    'body': '<p>A few months ago Damon Hill was waiting in a lounge at Heathrow airport, watching the departure board for news of his scheduled flight to Cologne. He had been invited to the opening of a museum dedicated to the career of Michael Schumacher, his old rival. The flight was delayed. And then delayed some more.</p> <p>He was sitting with another invited guest. This was Ross Brawn, the engineer who masterminded all of Schumacher’s seven world titles: two with Benetton, five with Ferrari, hardly one of them without controversy. “We’ve never really brought up some of the things that went on and that might be interesting to know,” Hill said on the phone this week. “But as you get older, you look back and it all seems mad. It’s so intense, everyone wants to win, and some people cross the boundary. It’s a choice people make.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/dec/28/19-for-19-unmissable-sporting-events-to-mark-in-your-diary\">19 for \\'19: unmissable sporting events to mark in your diary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Schumacher, the winner of 91 Formula One grands prix and seven world championships, will be 50 years old on Thursday. Last week was the fifth anniversary of his disappearance from public view as a result of a brain injury suffered in a low-speed fall while skiing with his son in France. The poignancy of a life risked at 200mph for so long being seemingly destroyed by so banal an accident was missed by no one, particularly his erstwhile rivals.</p> <p>Tribal loyalties usually lay behind the conflicting opinions on the way Schumacher conducted his career. In Germany and to the worldwide legion of Ferrari fans he was close to being a deity. Those supporting his fiercest rivals, who included not just Hill but Ayrton Senna, Jacques Villeneuve and Fernando Alonso, were not so fond of the tactics he and his team occasionally employed. But they will have found their feelings inevitably modified in the light of the tragedy that befell Schumacher and his family on the Combe de Saulire above Méribel on 29 December 2013.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>\\'I got glimpses of a softer and more generous, likeable guy. But as a racer he was always hard</p> <footer> <cite>Damon Hill on Michael Schumacher</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Hill’s initial sadness on hearing of the accident was complicated by an additional factor. He, too, has come to love skiing. When he heard that the accident had happened while Michael was on the slopes with his son, Mick, then aged 13, he felt a special sense of regret. “I would have loved to have gone skiing with my dad, you know?” he said on Monday. But his father, the double world champion Graham Hill, died in a plane crash in 1975, when his only son was 15.</p> <p>Now, like Damon, young Mick Schumacher is following in his father’s wheeltracks. At 19 years old, after winning this year’s European Formula Three championship with eight victories from 30 starts, he is moving up in 2019 to Formula Two, just one rung away from the top level, in which his father made his debut at 22. That last leap, of course, usually turns out to be harder than all the earlier ones put together. And as yet no one knows whether Mick Schumacher has inherited the combination of qualities – great skill, endless appetite for hard work, ruthlessness – that drove his father to unprecedented success.</p> <p>To begin with, the son of Schumacher chose to disguise his identity. His name appeared on the entry lists as Mick Betsch – his mother’s maiden name – or Mick Junior, which probably didn’t fool many people. But his career has been handled with discretion, particularly given the unusual degree of interest in his progress.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b7ebc2ae277c7dd0152817abed7a66e977124a34\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7ebc2ae277c7dd0152817abed7a66e977124a34/261_44_2746_1647/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Damon Hill with his rival Michael Schumacher\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Damon Hill with his rival Michael Schumacher in March 1997: ‘Although I didn’t agree with his approach, I know the pressure he was under’.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pascal Rondeau/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Discretion also characterises the way Corinna Schumacher and her husband’s manager, Sabine Kehm, have succeeded in drawing a veil of privacy around the family’s home in Switzerland, where special facilities were installed for Michael’s treatment and care. Kehm, a former newspaper journalist who became Michael’s personal press officer during his Ferrari years and took over as his manager in 2010, deserves some kind of award for the dignified way she has held the more intrusive elements of the media at bay. Now she manages Mick, too.</p> <p>Today, everyone with any direct relationship to Michael Schumacher, past or present, chooses their words with extreme care when discussing his life since the accident. “To even contemplate it is frightening,” Hill says. “Whatever my feeling was about Michael and the way he went about his career became irrelevant. From a human point of view, it was so upsetting.”</p> <p>In their racing days, particularly between 1994, when Schumacher won his first title by crashing into Hill in Adelaide, and 1996, when the Englishman finally triumphed at Suzuka, their duel seemed to be a double caricature of German arrogance and cunning on the one side and British diffidence and pluck on the other. Yet although Schumacher’s self-confidence made him seem invulnerable, occasionally Hill saw something else. “There was a different Michael,” he says, “but I didn’t know him. I got glimpses of a softer and more generous, likeable guy. But as a racer he was always hard.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors’ picks.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors\\' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors’ picks. </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The flight to Cologne was finally cancelled altogether, and Hill missed the opening of the museum. “It was nice of them to invite me,” he said. “I was a bit surprised.” Some time later he made a private visit, during which he went to have a look at the nearby town of Kerpen, Michael’s birthplace, where his father ran a kart track.</p> <p>“His legacy is huge,” Hill said. “He’s such a massive star in Germany, where everybody believed he could walk on water. Although I didn’t agree with his approach to sport, I know the pressure he was under. I was in the eye of the storm myself a little bit, when everybody wants to know about everything that happens in your life. Now his family have a lot to deal with. But we’re watching Mick getting on with it. So the story continues.”</p>',\n",

He <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/jul/31/f1-german-grand-prix-live\" title=\"\">finished 6.9 seconds ahead of second-placed Daniel Ricciardo</a> in the German Grand Prix – and that was with his engine turned down in order to make it last longer.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/30/nico-rosberg-pole-german-gp-lewis-hamilton\" title=\"\">pole-sitter Nico Rosberg</a> appeared stuck in reverse gear when the lights went out and Hamilton streaked past him followed by the Red Bulls of Ricciardo and Max Verstappen, who then made a bold move to go round his team-mate on the outside. We did not know it at the time but that was about as good as it got.</p> <p>There was some racing going on, such as that between Rosberg and Verstappen, and Fernando Alonso and Sergio Pérez, but up front Hamilton sat imperiously alone, like a monarch, his courtiers keeping a respectful distance.</p> <p>This was his 49th victory, which leaves him only two behind Alain Prost in the all‑time list. But it is the Briton’s irresistible form that makes him such a tough adversary for Rosberg – and everyone else for that matter. This was his fourth win in as many races and his sixth in seven outings. And he controlled the race from the front with the manner of a man about to win his fourth world title.</p> <p>The summer break is now upon us and Rosberg, tough though he is, might spend it reflecting that his holy grail quest for a first championship will probably have to wait for another year.</p> <p>In a three-stop race Mercedes and Red Bull split their strategies. But whatever you do with Hamilton makes little difference; he increased his pace only occasionally when he felt he had to kick clear of Ricciardo once more.</p> <p>The Mercedes head of motorsport, Toto Wolff, referring to Rosberg’s problems, said: “It seems that he did not have good setup and he was lacking grip. When he was trying to go faster and trying to attack he overheated the tyres and lacked pace.”</p> <p>When asked whether Rosberg could recover Wolff said: “A big yes. We have seen him starting the season extremely well and he had a very good end to 2015. There are still nine races to go. There are more than 200 points to collect and recover, so everything goes.</p> <p>“He is mentally very strong and nothing is done yet. He had a bad day but once he has recovered in the next couple of days I have no doubt he will come back very strong to Spa.”</p> <p>Referring to the incident that resulted in Rosberg being given a five-second penalty for forcing Verstappen off the track, Wolff said: “People get pushed out of the circuit all the time. One is being penalised and the other is not, so this is what I mean by inconsistent penalties.What is the remedy? We want to see hard racing but I can sympathise with the penalty. It is not that I am saying it was completely wrong.”</p> <p>Verstappen said he thought he and Rosberg would crash. “At one point I thought he was going to run into me, so I opened up. He didn’t turn in, he just kept driving straight, so I had to go off the track, otherwise he would’ve crashed.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Red Bull team principal, Christian Horner, was clear where the fault was. “The problem is [Rosberg] did a pretty bad job of it,” he said. “It looked like he kind of stopped and then kept going as if he was off to Cologne, and that’s a bit naughty. So that’s what caught the stewards’ attention.”</p> <p>Horner, though, looked delighted. This was the first time that Red Bull had achieved two podium positions since Hungary last year and it led to them leapfrogging Ferrari in the constructors’ championship; Ferrari were fifth and sixth, which is about what they deserved. There is much work to be done there; too much to fit in a four-week break.</p> <p>It was one of Jenson Button’s better days, with the McLaren driver finishing eighth. His team-mate Alonso, though, had a tougher time, finishing out of the points in 12th place. “We had to save a lot of fuel in the final part after all the battles we had in the first half of the race,” he said. “At the end I think we finished with 100 grams of fuel.”</p> <p>Alonso is convinced that only his negative radio messages are broadcast on TV – and he certainly sounded fed up.</p> <p>Felipe Massa looked unhappy, too, retiring halfway through the race after being hit by Renault’s Jolyon Palmer. The 35-year-old Brazilian looks all but finished with Formula One.</p>',\n",

It feels good to write those words and to soak in the outpouring of joy that comes with their thrilling victory over New Zealand. So let’s try to sum up:</p> \\n  <ul> \\n   <li>England are world champions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/14/england-new-zealand-cricket-world-cup-final-match-report-super-over\">after tying with New Zealand on 241 each after their respective 50 overs.</a> They both scored 15 in the super-over shootout – but England won thanks to hitting more boundaries in their 50 overs.</li> \\n   <li>It is England’s first ever Cricket World Cup and follows final defeats in 1979, 1987 and 1992. </li> \\n   <li><strong>Ben Stokes was England’s hero </strong>with the bat after he bludgeoned 15 from the final over of the regular innings, including a bizarre six by way of four overthrows. He was made man of the match.</li> \\n   <li>England’s captain <strong>Eoin Morgan</strong> said: “It’s been an absolutely incredible journey ... I still can’t quite believe it.”</li> \\n   <li>New Zealand’s captain <strong>Kane Williamson, </strong>who was made player of the tournament, said: “Just gutted ... There’s a lot of disappointment.”</li> \\n   <li>Barney Ronay <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/14/england-win-cricket-world-cup-and-for-once-the-nation-really-was-watching\">celebrates England’s victory as the culmination of four years of planning</a> after a disastrous defeat to the Kiwis in 2015.</li> \\n   <li>And Andy Bull reckons it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/14/lords-perfect-venue-greatest-one-day-game-ever-played\">the greatest game ever played</a>. <br><br></li> \\n  </ul> \\n  <p>And that’s it from me.

Jos Buttler, with his silky strokeplay and icy nerve. Ben Stokes, with his bloodymindedness and determination to atone for allowing a World Twenty20 final to end with four sixes. And Jofra Archer, with his preternatural calm in the Super Over: he’s gone from new boy to Atlas in three months. </p> \\n  <p>But hang on – three is not enough. Let’s not forget Chris Woakes, superb with the new ball, or Liam Plunkett, who showed his usual mastery in the middle overs when Kane Williamson was threatening to take control. Or Mark Wood, who bowled at 95mph and had to run that last run with Stokes. Or Roy and Bairstow, who powered England to the final with all those hundred partnerships. Or Adil Rashid, who took crucial wickets in the semi against Australia. Or Joe Root, who was one of the batsmen of the tournament, if not on song today. Or Moeen Ali, who was in the first XI at the start of this World Cup and probably deserved to be at the end. </p> \\n  <p>Or, above all, Eoin Morgan – the boss, the visionary, the driver of a revolution that has ended in triumph.</p> \\n </div> \\n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-14T18:50:18.207Z\">at 7.50pm BST</time></p> \\n</div> \\n<div id=\"block-5d2b764e8f0845f89e30d12a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \\n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-14T18:38:37.582Z\">7.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \\n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \\n  <p><strong>New Zealand would have been worthy winners.</strong> They certainly don’t deserve to be nearly men yet again, beaten finalists for the second time in a row, following all those semis down the decades.

Obviously, Roy and Bairstow could decide the outcome quite quickly, but might this be a day and a pitch for knocking the ball around and accumulating a nice steady five or six an over?

It was only my second time at Lord’s - the first was on a freezing wet day in April a few years before, where I was one of about six people in the ground watching Middlesex eke out what felt like 100 runs in a full day’s play. This couldn’t have been more different: a hot day, ground absolutely packed, and the best team in the world about to win a third successive world cup. For a South African who had never before seen international cricket, it was absolutely sensational to be there, to see these impossible heroes, whom I’d only ever read about, in the flesh. I was as stunned as everyone else when Kapil Dev pulled off a miracle and propelled India to the title - I had thought West Indies absolutely invincible - a lesson in the fact that the best can lose. Since SA’s ignominious departure from this tournament, I’m backing England to win the damn cup already.

It’s the men’s singles final at Wimbledon. It’s the British Grand Prix at Silverstone. It’s even, as I discovered driving home last night, <a href=\"http://www.rockinghamvillage.co.uk/news/2019/Dogs2019.pdf\">the Dog Show in Rockingham</a>. But then all those things happen every year. In St John’s Wood, London, just round the corner from the Beatles’ zebra crossing, something is happening that hasn’t happened for 27 years. ENGLAND ARE IN THE CRICKET WORLD CUP FINAL. </p> \\n  <p>It was in 1992, in Melbourne, that England last appeared in this fixture. They bowled well enough against Imran Khan’s Pakistan, and had the game under control, until Wasim Akram destroyed them with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XUqZbajy3I\">two balls of the greatest reverse swing you will ever goggle at in disbelief</a>. To find England in a World Cup final in England, you have to wind the videotape of life back even further, to 1979. Yes, it’s 40 years since these hosts last made it to their own party. To remember that day, you have to be middle-aged now; to have reported it, you have to be a pensioner.</p> \\n  <p>Breaking news: there is another team in this match, and they come trailing no such melancholy stats. New Zealand have reached their second successive World Cup final. But they do have their own version of 30 years of hurt, because they’ve been eternal bridesmaids. They have made it to Lord’s today by an unlikely route, starting sturdily, then losing three games in a row, including one against England. But they are over-achievers, they’re under less pressure than England, they have a strong attack, and the weather – wet this morning, due to be grey all day – could hardly be making them feel more at home. The British bookies have England as favourites; if anything, I’d have them as slight outsiders.<br></p> \\n  <p>Play starts at 10.30am, British “summer” time.</p> \\n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"528835f81905da8dd82c833226397a44d28756db\"> \\n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/528835f81905da8dd82c833226397a44d28756db/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"MCC members wait in the rain to be allowed in.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \\n   <figcaption> \\n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">MCC members wait in the rain to be allowed in.</span> \\n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> \\n   </figcaption> \\n  </figure> \\n </div> \\n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-14T09:38:18.386Z\">at 10.38am BST</time></p> \\n</div> \\n<div id=\"block-5d291c9e8f08cf92bb76efbd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \\n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-12T23:50:27.008Z\">12.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \\n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \\n  <p><strong>Pre-preamble</strong></p> \\n  <p>Tim will be here shortly.

The Hamburg Sea Devils’ second touchdown was a 35-yard flea flicker, a rainbow that found gold. Their fourth came on a fake reverse. No stone was left unturned, no dagger unblemished, no ruse untouched.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/15/denver-broncos-nfl-super-bowl-hangover\">Denver has a Super Bowl hangover –\\xa0and the room is starting to spin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“We had saved a few things for that game that we hadn’t run all year,” recalls Casey Bramlet, Hamburg’s quarterback for World Bowl XV and defending NFL Europe champion for … well, nine years running now. “Luckily they worked out. I remember one of their linebackers, after we hit another big play on them – he was so mad. And they weren’t prepared for it. He said: ‘Just play football.’”</p> <p>On 23 June 2007, Bramlet threw for 347 yards and four touchdowns in a 37-28 Hamburg victory over Frankfurt, the highest-scoring title game in the history of NFL Europa/NFL Europe/World League of American Football. It also happened to be the last championship game: on June 29, the NFL folded up the tents, closing its spring developmental league after 16 years and a reported $30m in annual losses.</p> <p>“I think, in the end, it probably comes down to money,” says Bramlet, these days a financial adviser in his native Wyoming, a husband, a father, and – as the final World Bowl MVP – the answer to a killer trivia question. “It’s a shame they don’t have one [today]. It was just starting to kind of pick up steam. I think they could’ve been successful. I don’t know how long it would’ve taken.</p> <p>“When it was over, I said: ‘In the next five years, they’ll have another one.’ And here we are, nine years later, and we still don’t.”</p> <p>In hindsight, it reads as audacious lunacy, pitched somewhere between Terry Bradshaw and Terry Southern, the apex and nadir of Yankee sporting hubris dancing cheek-to-cheek across a curious but indifferent stage. Europe sent America its tired, its poor, its huddled masses yearning to breathe free. The NFL sent Europe its Shane Boyd, Ryan Van Dyke and BJ Symons.</p> <p>“That’s the hard part,” Bramlet chuckles. “People don’t want to watch bad football.”</p> <p>And therein lies the rub, nearly a decade after last rites. Like the Monkees and the vinyl renaissance, what’s old is new again: earlier this month, NFL executives floated the possibility of diving back into the developmental league pool, no doubt noticing the May-June black hole in the league’s live television calendar in an age when real-time content is one of the few bright lights still beaming across an oversaturated media plain. Coaches such as Pittsburgh’s Mike Tomlin, Baltimore’s John Harbaugh and New Orleans’ Sean Payton – the latter of whom once played quarterback in England for the Leicester Panthers – have tossed their weight behind the idea in recent years.</p> <p>“We’ve reached a point where we really should be looking more at a developmental league, and I really expect that to begin here in the next year or so,” Dallas Cowboys executive vice president Stephen Jones, a member of the league’s competition committee, told CBS Sports. “We lost a lot of money on NFL Europe, but there were a lot of things the league did well and for all of those reasons – coaches, officiating, players, quarterbacks in particular – it’s something we really do need to be looking at and studying. The time might be right to do it.”</p> <p>So what was the problem? The Europe part? The spring football part? The scout team part? All of the above? Were the ratings and budgetary bars set too high? By NFL standards, NFL Europe was a financial turkey: according to a 2007 ESPN.com autopsy, the league never sniffed a profit as a European-only enterprise. Like any start-up, it was continually tweaked, re-tweaked, re-painted and rebranded. Launched as the WLAF in 1991, it bombed in domestic outposts such as Birmingham, Orlando and San Antonio while the curiosity factor gained the circuit some traction in London, Frankfurt and Barcelona. For a while.</p> <p>Yet it was also a venture that gave former Vikings and Saints wide receiver Mike Jones, an African American, his first head coaching gig at the age of 44. It created a laboratory for up-and-coming coaches and officials and a trial balloon for rules and broadcast experiments.</p> <p>“You know the field camera that they use in the NFL? They used it in NFL Europe,” says Jones, who would steer the Frankfurt Galaxy to three World Bowls in four seasons, winning the loop’s penultimate crown in 2006. “These parties that they have before the games, the concerts … they did that in NFL Europe. I think a lot of things came from the testing in NFL Europe of what would be good and what would not be good.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1d1b20d2bb30da0583b07f8100c1c84523869e9e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d1b20d2bb30da0583b07f8100c1c84523869e9e/0_95_2126_1275/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Frankfurt’s head coach Mike Jones.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frankfurt’s head coach Mike Jones.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alexander Heimann/Bongarts/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Arguably the most significant fossils NFL Europe left behind were the games themselves – live game action for the bottom half of NFL rosters and, more importantly, live game footage. Yes, it involved players many Americans hadn’t heard of, let alone a bemused German, Spanish, Dutch or Scottish audience. Yes, it was essentially the competitive equivalent of the fourth preseason tilt over any given August, practice squads dressed in different colors crossing swords on a different continent. Yes, the echo-ey Fox broadcasts often sounded as if the games were contested within the confines of a gargantuan metal pipe.</p> <p>Which isn’t to say that, even if the casts and sets were flawed, the basic premise somehow lacked merit. Or reconsideration. To put it another way, as a football consumer, which option would you prefer in the spring: the chance to watch – even sporadically – an eight-team, seven-week spring developmental loop; or copious internet reports from “Organized Team Activities,” or OTAs, a menu that consists primarily of players in helmets and shorts playing glorified two-hand touch?</p> <p>“It was a league to develop talents, to develop guys from what they were into what they could be,” says Jason Hall, a former defensive end with Buffalo, Carolina and Tennessee who found his stride – and his mojo – with the Cologne Centurions in 2007 as NFL Europe’s last Defensive MVP.</p> <p>“For me, that absolutely happened. The value was just in terms of [the fact] guys that are on the lower end of the roster, you’re not getting much better in OTAs. You’re not getting much better, honestly, in camps. Maybe just in position-drill work, but in terms of your overall game, you’re talking about team stuff, 11-on-11 … you’re just not getting the quality reps that you need. It’s one thing to do things in shorts and helmets and all that, but football, especially when you’re talking about line play — this is all physicality, this is all hand-to-hand combat. And if you’re not getting that stuff at full-speed, full-tilt, it’s just not the same.”</p> <p>Cologne offered Hall plenty of physicality, plenty of combat, plenty of full-speed reps and enough space to sink or swim. Undrafted out of the University of Tennessee, it also afforded a reprieve from the angst of roster math. When his position coach encouraged the 6ft 3in pass-rusher to stop thinking, to ditch the paralysis by analysis and just play, things started to click.</p> <p>“Sometimes the best way to develop players is giving them less to chew on,” Hall says, “and really just allowing them to be successful with a limited toolbox. And then you can add from there. But if you throw them the whole toolbox to see if they could get it (at once), nobody really does.</p> <p>“A lot of it is just read-and-react. It’s football, and that’s what I realized going into my senior year of college and finally in NFL Europe: ‘Man, it’s just football.’”</p> <p>They were units of the unproven, the unknown (and in many cases) the unwanted, us-against-the-world on the other side of the globe. Lifelong friendships were formed in the journeys from hotel to stadium to hotel again, the travails of a league that some of its staffers gleefully referred to as “NFL Economy.” Jones says they usually took two train rides the whole season, and “the rest of the time, we were on the bus … we knew how to spend that money over there.”</p> <p>“You were a group of 40 guys and you’re in a hotel, you’re all in the same hotel, you all eat at the same little cafeteria every day and so you’re [with] each other all the time,” Bramlet recalls. “I think you formed more of a bond, more of a college feel versus an NFL feel.”</p> <p>In the decade since, Bramlet would return to Europe with his wife to revisit those old haunts and bonds. Hall says he’s been back to Germany twice. For Jones, the league presented a chance to teach players about representing their families, franchises, and their home country abroad. And for his daughters, then middle-school age, it was an opportunity “to visit way more places than I could ever imagine. Rome. Paris. Every other day, they were on a train going somewhere, so it was a great experience for them, because here they [were] given an opportunity to go in a foreign land and travel as freely as they wanted to.”</p> <p>The NFL’s commitment to its “International Series”– in which a smattering of regular-season contests are played in London, an agreement that some have surmised as a dry run for possible relocation or expansion – probably puts the odds of a return to a European satellite operation between slim and none. But NFL Europe alums don’t see why the core developmental concepts <em>there</em> couldn’t float in principle <em>here</em>. Same calendar, different country.</p> <p>“To be quite honest, the World League should’ve been in the States, NFL Europe should’ve been in the States,” says Hall, a trainer who works with 60-some clients at Kettle Corps in Marietta, Georgia, just outside of Atlanta. “I understand the [desire] to ‘globalize’ the game. It wasn’t the right strategy to globalize the game. The value of a developmental league is still there, regardless of where you’re going to have it. We had our training camps in Tampa. Literally, you could have the whole league in Tampa. Literally, you could play back-to-back games on the same field.</p> <p>“People are scared of spring ball. People are scared of that, because the NFL has such a monopoly on the game. People are afraid of trying to corner any space in that market, because you have a fear of just getting crushed.”</p> <p>And as long as the NCAA is providing the milk – in this case, labor – for free, why invest in another herd of cows? Even the results of the NFL Europe’s strongest argument, quarterback development, can be taken as something of a mixed bag. Super Bowl starters Kurt Warner, Brad Johnson and Jake Delhomme all famously apprenticed in the circuit at one point or another, while Jon Kitna and Scott Mitchell used the league as a springboard for solid (if unspectacular) careers of their own.</p> <p>All of which inevitably dovetails into the counter-argument: for every Warner to come out of NFL Europe, you could point to five Spergon Wynns. The top 10 highest-rated career passers in the league’s history – Danny Wuerffel, David Archer, Rohan Davey, Jim Arellanes, JT O’Sullivan, Reggie Slack, Dave Ragone, Gibran Hamdan, Craig Nall and Jonathan Quinn – would combine for just 49 regular-season NFL starts, nearly half of which belong to Archer (23), with a collective 47 regular-season touchdowns and 71 interceptions among them. As with David Hasselhoff’s singing career, what sells in Deutschland doesn’t always always rack up the same numbers stateside.</p> <p>“I remember telling people that you don’t play over there to get rich,” says Bramlet, whose resume included stints with six NFL clubs and the CFL’s Winnipeg Blue Bombers. “You went over there to play and to get some experience and to get some more game film. Because a lot of the time, you were going over there knowing that you were probably interviewing for the other 30-31 teams, because you knew you probably weren’t going to be with the same team when you got back.”</p> <p>Roughly six weeks after he held the last World Bowl trophy aloft, Washington – the franchise that had allocated him – cut Bramlet loose.</p> <p>“Yes, there are definitely benefits to keeping (players in-house), but you can’t replace getting live reps,” the former quarterback says. ”If you’re the starter or you’re the backup, it’s probably better to stay with your NFL team. But if you’re a fourth-string quarterback or a fourth-string guy, it’s probably better to go out there and get some reps.”</p> <p>Pain is temporary. Tape is forever. Late in 2007, while Bramlet was practicing with the Miami Dolphins, Randy Mueller, then the club’s general manager, made a point to pull him aside. Given that this was his third club in less than six months, the former NFL Europe standout wasn’t sure what to think.</p> <p>“Do you know why we signed you?” Mueller asked.</p> <p>“Well, the reason we brought you in for a workout was that game in Frankfurt, the World Bowl. I watched you play in that game.”</p> <p>“That was a direct effect of what I got from that,” Bramlet says. “Just having another opportunity to play and get better. You never know who’s watching. And sure enough, I ended up getting another opportunity <em>because</em> of that.”</p> <p>What goes around comes around, eventually. Even from halfway across the world.</p>',\n",

The ministry said the aim of the research was not to look into individual incidences, expose doping scandals of uncover statutory offences, but to take an in-depth look at the history of doping.</p> <p>Süddeutsche Zeitung said cuts to the document could \"explain why the obstacles that stood in the way of publication, have now disappeared so suddenly\".</p> <p>On Saturday the newspaper reported that doping of athletes with anabolic steroids, testosterone and oestrogen and doping research was conducted over a period of decades and was state funded, with the BISp investing almost £4.5m in medicine research facilities in Freiburg, Cologne and Saarbrücken.</p> <p>The report – carried out by researchers at Humboldt University in Berlin and the Westfälische Wilhelms University in Münster – detailed doping of football players, including three members of the 1966 West Germany World Cup final team who lost to England at Wembley.</p> <p>A letter from the Fifa official Mihailo Andrejevic informed the German Athletic Association president, Max Danz, about the \"fine traces\" of the banned stimulant ephedrine discovered.</p> <p>Germany\\'s opposition party, the Social Democrats, have called for a special meeting of the sports committee to look into claims that government funds had been used in systematic doping of athletes.</p> <p>Andreas Singler, a sports scientist and member of the Evaluation Commission of Freiburg Sport Medicine, whose research was cited as part of the report, told the Guardian it should not be a surprise to people that West German athletes were doped.</p> <p>\"It has been well-known for a long time,\" he said, although he disputed that the government of the time was responsible.</p> <p>\"It supported the research about the effects and side effects of the drugs but that doesn\\'t mean it was necessarily with the aim of doing doping,\" he said.</p> <p>\"I think the misuse potential was very high and there was a hope from some in the government, not from the ministry itself, but the specialists for sports issues. I think they perhaps expected conditions that made it possible to have a chance to win, not only against the East Germans, but also the US.\"</p>',\n",

    "* Rate limits\n",
    "* Disallowed uses\n",
    "* Limitations for sharing data\n",
    "* Intellectual Property considerations\n",

    "While most of these are self-explanatory, its worthwhile taking some time to go over what rate limits are and how they are controlled. \n",
    "\n",
    "Rate limits are the upper bound placed on how many API requests a user can make in a given amount of time. These number differ between websites and even user types. The idea is to limit the rate of requests and ensure the website isn't overrun with traffic. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, rate limits are controlled in two ways. Some websites will have built-in systems that will detect over-use and throttle or revoke access for a token that is over-requesting. This is the system The Guardian API uses. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other websites rely on the honour system, asking you to abide by your guidelines. In these cases the risk of exceeding limits is higher (since there is no throttling) and if you run a greater risk of being blacklisted if you exceed the API's rate limits. "

       "  'body': '<p>Ambition used to be a dirty little word (schmutzig, perhaps) in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/bundesligafootball\" title=\"\">Bundesliga</a>. Apart from Bayern, the loudmouths from Bavaria who could always be relied upon to brashly insist on their inalienable right to win the title every bloody season, others were far too happy keeping a low profile and expectations down. Everybody wanted to be the underdog: better to spend another season in mediocrity than to have ideas above your stations. That was the Bundesrepublik Deutschland (West Germany) way to do business.</p> <p>Mercifully, things have changed for the better as a direct result of the 2006 World Cup, when Jürgen Klinsmann took a young, unfancied, much-maligned team to dizzying heights with American fitness methods, motivational talks straight out of The Office and, crucially, raw, extra-strength aspiration. These days, fans expect their clubs to at least have a go, and you can count the remaining old-school, \"better meek than sorry\"-type managers on Abu Hamza\\'s right hand: Friedhelm Funkel is the last unashamedly negative manager standing.</p> <p>The dour Frankfurt coach with the pudding-bowl haircut will probably never allow himself a bit of optimism. For him, the No1 spot is only a treacherous 15 places above the relegation zone. Last season, when Eintracht put together a great, late run to come within striking distance of a Champions League spot, he quickly poured cold water on the supporters\\' hopes. His team dutifully responded with a few timid defeats and finished mid-table. Funkel felt vindicated.</p> <p>But this type of sporting submissiveness disguised as realism has run its course. If there\\'s one overarching, dramatic theme to this season\\'s wildly unpredictable madness - a season that has seen on average more than three goals per game and 58,000 snooty Berliners turn up in the Olympic stadium because they wanted to experience the magic of Hoffenheim (the smallest club in the world) only to find that their own, much more modest team can play some really decent stuff as well -&#xa0;then it\\'s a firm commitment to get ahead by going forward, all the time. \"I want our football to be worth watching, that\\'s more important than finishing in a particular position in the table,\" said Dortmund manager Jürgen Klopp before the season. This seems to have become this campaign\\'s unofficial mantra. Cynical 1-1s are out, crazy 3-3s or even 5-4s are in. Bundesliga clubs are behaving like a bunch of drunk A-level students the night after the final exam: forget the results, let\\'s party. \"I never thought people were that desperate for spectacle\" said Uli Hoeneß.</p> <p>\"Kloppo\" might take a bit longer to turn former giants Borussia around but, elsewhere, attack-minded, risk-loving managers are winning both plaudits and many matches. Ralf Rangnick (Hoffenheim), Bruno Labbadia (Leverkusen), Klinsmann (Bayern), Felix Magath (Wolfsburg) and Martin Jol (Hamburg) are firmly wedded to offensive principles, as are Lucien Favre at Hertha and Fred Rutten at Schalke, who both probably don\\'t have the right players for their ideas just yet.</p> <p>Even in places like Gladbach and Cologne, where the football will never quite keep up with the hopes of supporters, the appetite for thrills seems stronger than the fear of relegation. Christoph Daum\\'s team climbed to eighth in the table after defeating Hannover 2-1, their fifth win in seven games. Naturally, the whole city is already dreaming about Europe again and contemplating the return of Lukas Podolski from Munich, even if they can never afford them. Soon, men with goats in tow (Köln is the only club with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/series/theknowledge\" title=\"\">a real four-legged mascot</a>) will probably roam the streets, asking for donations to supplement Prinz Poldi\\'s royal paypacket.</p> <p>With three-quarters of the league legitimately fighting for some sort of success, the league\\'s never been more competitive, at least in quantitative terms. But can this goal-glut be sustained beyond the opening weeks, when it\\'s easy to feel optimistic? Already, one or two football analysts like Frank Wormuth (head of coaching education at the German FA) say that what we\\'re seeing is the result of \"too much zonal marking\" and there are signs that managers are beginning to curb their attacking instincts a little bit.</p> <p>Martin Jol, for example, has realised that his team can neither be relied upon to come back from 2-0 down all the time (they did in three of the first four games) nor necessarily turn into \"tigers with big balls\" as he would like them to. For all their attacking flair, they\\'ve lost three away games 3-0 and urgently needed a dose of tactical pragmatism. Against Dortmund, the Dutchman sacrificed deep-lying attacker Paolo Guerrero and played defensive midfielder Collin Benjamin instead. \"It wasn\\'t so good for the eye, but good for the result,\" Jol said after the <a href=\"http://www.101greatgoals.com/videodisplay/1744730/\" title=\"\">2-1 victory</a>&#xa0;that HSV earned with solid defending and a couple of excellent counter-attacks. \"It looked as if Huub Stevens (Jol\\'s famously negative predecessor) had decided on the strategy,\" wrote Berliner Zeitung, slightly in shock. \"Hamburg remain a strange experiment,\" added the paper. \"They don\\'t play the way their manager wants them to but win anyway.\"</p> <p>The same was somewhat true of Bayern who soaked up a million Schalke corners, crosses and long shots to <a href=\"http://www.101greatgoals.com/videodisplay/1747603/\" title=\"\">win 2-1</a> in the Veltins-Arena on Sunday, largely thanks to another sensational performance from Franck Ribéry and two frighteningly efficient counter-attacks. A classic Hitzfeld-era performance, a million miles away from Klinsmann\\'s purist ideals. Both he and Jol have obviously seen the need to moderate their principles, if only to do things a bit differently to the rest of the wild bunch.</p> <p>The fact that Hamburg and Bayern were the big winners of the weekend (Hoffenhein lost and Leverkusen somehow managed to draw 3-3 after going 3-0 up away to Karlsruhe) poses an interesting dilemma. Will the coaches conclude that less is more this season and adjust their philosophies for good? Or have we seen merely temporary measures designed to find some stability and time for the further development of perfect attacking?&#xa0;</p> <p>In either case, a bit of defensive rigidity can only increase the overall quality of a team\\'s output in the long run. Balance might not be what the Bundesliga wants right now, but it is certainly what they need - if they do want to make the next step and challenge in Europe again. That should be the natural ambition of Europe\\'s financially healthiest league, especially in these troubled times.</p> <p><strong>Results:</strong> Köln 2-1 Hannover, Hamburg 2-1 Dortmund, Bielefeld 0-2 Gladbach, Wolfsburg 3-0 Cottbus, Karlsruhe 3-3 Leverkusen 3-3, Bochum 0-0* Bremen, Schalke 1-2 Bayern, Frankfurt 2-2 Stuttgart, Berlin 1-0 Hoffenheim</p> <p><a href=\"http://touchline.onthespot.co.uk/guardian/StatsCentre.asp?Lang=0&amp;CTID=12\" title=\"\">Latest Bundesliga table</a></p> <p>&#xa0;<em>*Their team could only draw away to Bochum but Werder supporters became the true stars of the weekend when they decided they didn\\'t want to look the other way. A few neo-Nazis had unfurled a banner in their block but the rest of the Bremen fans started chanting \"Nazis out\" and called in the police. The whole stadium soon joined in the chorus.
