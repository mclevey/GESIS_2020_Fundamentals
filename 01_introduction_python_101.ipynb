    "\n",
    "First, you should always start by thinking carefully about what problem you are trying to solve. In the process, you may realized that what you thought was one problem is actually several related small problems. As you think things through, decompose the big problems into smaller problems, and think about how those problems relate to one another. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, it is usually a good idea to start by writing \"[pseudocode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode)\", which is a bit like starting a writing project (e.g. a journal article) with an outline. Doing this will carefully and thoughtfully will result in much better code, and frankly better data analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Third, in a data collection, cleaning, and analysis context, you will likely be doing a fair amount of exploratory work at the start of a new project. While I don't presume to speak for anyone else, I find it helpful to be doing this open ended exploration **at the same time** as I think through the problems I need to solve in a data analysis. I usually do this in a Jupyter Notebook (like this one) while I write notes in a text file or a physical notebook. I develop functions and refactor my code later, when I have a clear sense of what I want to do and how it should to be done. To continue the writing analogy, this is a bit like figuring out what your idea or argument is by doing free writing, developing an outline as your thinking evolves. Then, at some point, you open a new file and start writing cleaner more structured text. "
