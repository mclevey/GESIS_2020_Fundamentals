They are frost hardy and even if cut to the ground by a prolonged Arctic blast, they will soon resurface as if nothing happened. With this surprisingly rugged constitution for an exotic plant from the mountain forests of the Canary Islands, it is no wonder the plant has been granted an award of garden merit (AGM) by the Royal Horticultural Society.</p> <p>If you love their look, but fancy something a bit stouter and stockier, there is a hybrid between <em>E melli</em><em>fera</em> and <em>E stygiana</em> called <em>E \u2018pasteuri\u2019</em> with a deeper, richer colouration, as if you\u2019ve whacked up the contrast on the Instagram filter settings.

I also assumed they made honey, stung, and lived in a hive with a queen bee and her workers. But only honeybees fit this description, and they account for just a handful or so of the astonishing <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/521S48a\" title=\"\">25,000 bee species worldwide</a>.

These solitary bees are often named according to how they construct their nests: from plasterer bees, which line their nest with a waterproof substance, to mining bees, which excavate elaborate underground burrows, and leafcutter bees, which plug the entrance with small discs of leaves cut from rose bushes.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Bees not only pollinate the flora that feeds other insects, birds and mammals, but also one in three mouthfuls we eat</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This month a landmark <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/06/human-society-under-urgent-threat-loss-earth-natural-life-un-report\" title=\"\">UN global assessment report</a> warned that a million wildlife species were facing extinction, and at an unprecedented rate. Thousands of bee species will be among them. In Europe, 37% of them have experienced a recent decline in populations, and 9% face extinction; almost a quarter of those in North America are at increasing risk of becoming extinct. In other parts of the world, where data is limited, they all face similar threats from intensive farming, climate breakdown and invasive species. And their demise is <a href=\"https://www.ipbes.net/assessment-reports/pollinators\" title=\"\">potentially catastrophic</a> for nature and humankind.</p> <p>A bee visiting a flower is an act of nature that has been playing out for more than 100m years. Flowering plants evolved with bees, developing rich perfumes, colourful petals and nectar to entice them to visit. As the bee moves from flower to flower, collecting nectar to fuel her flight and pollen to feed her family, she moves pollen from the male part of the flower to the female part, allowing the plant to produce seeds and reproduce. The poet Kahlil Gibran beautifully described this symbiotic relationship. \u201cTo a bee a flower is the fountain of life, and to the flower the bee is a messenger of love.\u201d</p> <p>It makes bees a linchpin in nature and of modern agriculture. Not only do they pollinate trees, whose oxygen we breathe, and which mitigate the climate crisis, they also pollinate the flora that feed other insects, birds and mammals in the food chain and one in three mouthfuls that we eat. Bees boost the yield of 90 commercially produced crops. These include most fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds and spices that we eat, as well as coffee, and fodder for livestock. The <a href=\"https://www.ipbes.net/assessment-reports/pollinators\" title=\"\">annual contribution</a> of pollination services to the global economy has been estimated at $577bn (\u00a3453bn). </p> <p>But there is a contradiction at the heart of our farming system. In the last five decades there has been a threefold increase in the volume of production of those 90 bee-dependent crops. This has turned farms into industrial food producers. As a result, wild-flower meadows that provided food and nesting sites for solitary bees and bumblebees have been wiped out. Europe\u2019s largest bumblebee, the endangered <em>Bombus fragrans</em>, is just one example of a species seriously <a href=\"https://www.iucn.org/content/bad-news-europe%E2%80%99s-bumblebees\" title=\"\">threatened</a> by intensive farming, which is destroying its native habitat on the steppes of Ukraine and Russia. </p> <p>Without food and habitat to sustain wild pollinators, modern farming has become reliant on trucking in managed honeybee hives when crops are in bloom, and flying in factory-bred bumblebees to pollinate tomatoes and other crops grown in greenhouses. This can spread lethal parasites and disease to wild bees, including the giant golden bumblebee of Patagonia, which is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/04/the-battle-to-save-the-worlds-biggest-bumblebee-from-european-invaders\" title=\"\">now threatened with extinction</a>.</p> <p>Neonicotinoid pesticides have been linked to bee deaths, and a successful campaign to ban these toxic chemicals was orchestrated across Europe, leading to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/27/eu-agrees-total-ban-on-bee-harming-pesticides\" title=\"\">EU introducing a total ban</a> on the outdoor use of the most common ones last year. </p> <p>But that alone won\u2019t save bees. Now we need a similar campaign to ban herbicides and bring back wild flowers and wild bees. Research shows that the greater the diversity of bees attracted to a field of crops by the presence of wild flowers, the better pollinated those crops will be. In some trials, harvests doubled or even tripled, because solitary bees can pollinate some flowering plants <a href=\"https://www.worldbeeday.org/en/did-you-know/189-pollinator-diversity-for-reliable-food-production.html\" title=\"\">100 times more effectively than honeybees</a>. </p> <p>Yet subsidies over the past 70 years have encouraged farmers to use chemicals and fertilisers that destroy ecosystems and degrade the soil, and bring in managed honeybees where wild bees once flourished. We urgently need to bring nature back into the way we produce food.</p> <p>As taxpayers, voters and consumers, we can help make that change. The German state of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/03/bavaria-bees-farming-petition-conservation-nature\" title=\"\">Bavaria is leading the way</a>. The state\u2019s governor, Markus S\u00f6der, announced recently that a \u201csave the bees\u201d petition signed by 1.75 million people would be passed into law. The petition demanded 20% of farming land to be made bee-friendly within six years and 30% by 2030, to reverse the decline in flora and fauna. And S\u00f6der made it clear that farmers would be financially supported to carry out the transformation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/15/climate-change-politics-environmental-crisis-government\">Has the politics of climate change finally reached a tipping point? | John Vidal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the UK, a farm that used to receive substantial subsidies to produce crops using conventional practices now uses \u00a3250,000 of taxpayers\u2019 money to allow nature to do the work.

But the ban included an exemption for greenhouses, raising fears the chemical could still wash out into watercourses.</p> \n<p>Vytenis Andriukaitis, the commissioner for health and food safety, said: \u201cIt has to be noted that we have been very strict with neonicotinoids having banned the outdoor use of three of them lately and, following commission\u2019s proposal, another one has been voted down by Member States no later than this week.</p> \n<p>\u201cAs regards to the Bee Guidance document we have been stuck for several (6) years. The proposal of the Commission that gathered the approval of qualified majority of member states would have allowed to move a few steps forward.</p> \n<p>\u201cI understand that the Parliament would have wanted us to move 10 steps forward but we don\u2019t have the support of member states to do this and it is needed also to be sure of implementation.

But if you are looking for a chemical- or manure-free fertiliser then, please, read on.</p> <p>We start with a hazard warning. It really will smell. A lot. Your garden neighbours will notice. They may disapprove.</p> <p>First, you will need a container with a tight lid. A plastic barrel with a screw top is best. Ours once held mango chutney. Keep it far from gardening friends.</p> <p>We use two plant varieties as the base: comfrey, our preference, and nettles. With comfrey, you might wait until before or after flowering as bees and other insects love them.</p> <p>We make around three preparations a season. It couldn\u2019t be more simple. Cut armfuls of comfrey and/or nettles. Pack them in a barrel. Fill with water until near the top. Remember to tightly screw on the lid. And wait.</p> <p>After a few weeks, you will be happily gardening, but will be distracted by an oddly pervasive odour.</p> <p>When you lift the lid, you may see a crust, with white, worm-like funghi. Your brew is ready. Be prepared for the stink (though you likely won\u2019t be). I\u2019d advise long and strong rubberised gloves. You\u2019ll also need a jug.</p> <p>Pour your brew into a watering can. We vary from a ratio of around 20-1 to around 10 (sometimes stronger), depending on potency and impatience. Top up slowly with water. It may bubble like honeycomb.</p> <p>Apply liberally to the soil late in the day or your neighbours may complain. We give stronger doses to squashes than leaf crops. We also water it in. Take care not to spill on your clothes. Your \u2018herbal tea\u2019 will give your growing a boost, help replenish plants.

According to a report from the Bumblebee Conservation Trust, they could face long-term problems from future heatwaves. But we can give them a helping hand.</p> <p>You don\u2019t need to keep honeybees to help bees \u2013 in fact, <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6374/392\" title=\"\">a 2018 study commissioned by Cambridge University</a> suggests that this can harm wild bees. It\u2019s thought that the more bees there are in an area, the more competition there is for nectar and pollen; if every shopping centre has three or four hives on the roof, what does that mean for the wild bees?</p> <p>It would be easy to assume that our built-up towns and cities are deserts for pollinators. Yet among the grey is also green: parks, gardens, balconies, doorsteps and window boxes, each with the potential <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/14/city-bees-allotments-gardens-help-arrest-decline-study\" title=\"\">to feed a city of bees</a>. In fact, urban spaces can, in some instances, be better for bees and other pollinators than the countryside, where wildlife <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/18/saving-bees-save-ourselves-pollinators\" title=\"\">has largely been pushed out</a> to make space for more crops and livestock. Gardens and parks are home to a greater variety of flowering plants than in the wild, and for a longer season, too. What\u2019s more, we\u2019re less likely to use pesticides in them, enabling bees and other pollinators to feed safely. Indeed, <a href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2018.0807\" title=\"\">a study published last summer in the journal Proceedings </a><a href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2018.0807\" title=\"\">Of </a><a href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2018.0807\" title=\"\">The Royal Society B</a> found that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/27/bumblebees-thrive-in-towns-more-than-countryside\" title=\"\">bumblebee colonies in urban areas were actually stronger than those in the wild</a>. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2b638083d7c2e8ada0beb88f436326d01c96a935\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b638083d7c2e8ada0beb88f436326d01c96a935/64_297_3428_4526/757.jpg\" alt=\"Wooden insect house decorative bug hotel, ladybird and bee home for butterfly hibernation and ecological gardening\" width=\"757\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bee hotels mimic the cavities where solitary bees nest. Photograph: Alamy</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marjan Cermelj/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most bees are solitary: in the British Isles there are about 267 species of bee; of those, 220 species of wild bee are solitary. These nest individually; the male and female mate then the female finds somewhere to lay her eggs. She makes a series of cells, in which she lays an egg on a \u201ccake\u201d of pollen and nectar, and then, coming to the end of her life cycle, she dies, leaving her young to feed themselves on the stores she has left for them. Some nest in the ground, in lawns or sandy borders. Others nest in cavities, such as walls, old plant stems and holes in dead wood. Many survive in urban areas.</p> <p>Wild bees include 25 species of bumblebee, which, like the honeybee, live in a colony led by a queen: she largely stays in the nest while her workers forage for nectar and pollen to feed the grubs. Nests are annual, and you may be lucky enough to find one beneath a shed or hedge. The tree bumblebee nests in bird boxes.</p> <p>To help wild bees, you don\u2019t need to buy loads of kit. You don\u2019t even need a garden. The first thing to do is grow as many flowering plants as you can cram into your outdoor space. All bees need nectar and pollen, both to feed themselves and their young. Some emerge from hibernation as early as February, while others wait until September. Therefore, growing flowering plants from February to November is key. Grow crocus and primrose in spring, lavender in summer, and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/16/how-to-grow-verbena-bonariensis-gardens\" title=\"\">Verbena bonariensis</a></em> and echinacea in autumn.</p> <p>The second thing to do is to create nesting habitats. If you have a garden, start <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/oct/27/how-to-compost-gardening-advice\" title=\"\">a compost heap</a>, or let an area of grass grow long, and leave twigs and leaf litter to accumulate at the back of your borders. Bumblebees might make a nest or even hibernate here. You could also erect a bee hotel \u2013 a box designed to mimic the cavities in which some solitary bees nest \u2013 in a garden, balcony or doorstep.</p> <p>If we make all our green spaces bee friendly, we will help tackle the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/03/climate-crisis-is-about-to-put-humanity-at-risk-un-scientists-warn\" title=\"\">extinction crisis</a> head on.</p> <h2>Five species to help this summer</h2> <p><strong>Leafcutter</strong><strong> solitary bees</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a7decbddcc30ff7de0708f89eb9b559ac440bc95\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7decbddcc30ff7de0708f89eb9b559ac440bc95/0_0_5100_3387/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A leafcutter bee, Megachile centuncularis, nest-building in bamboo tubes in a UK garden\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leafcutters will readily use bee hotels.

The robo-bees can hover on the spot, fly in any direction, and even flip 360 degrees around pitch or roll axes. Because the robots\u2019 wings are made of a lightweight film made of mylar, the material used in space blankets, it is safe for people to work around them.</p> <p>The new drones, which can travel at up to 15mph, are also more efficient in their flight than those with helicopter-style blades, meaning their batteries can last longer. They can be fitted with spatial sensors so that they autonomously fly from plant to plant, avoiding each other and other obstacles as they go.</p> <p>Previous attempts to perfect the technology in Harvard and elsewhere have produced useful models, but have proven to be too fragile or unable to navigate around each other.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d74d33854929f512301621e311f8885171558c21\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d74d33854929f512301621e311f8885171558c21/0_49_768_960/400.jpg\" alt=\"Mat\u011bj Kar\u00e1sek holds a DelFly robot.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mat\u011bj Kar\u00e1sek holds a DelFly robot.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Boffey/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mat\u011bj Kar\u00e1sek, a researcher working on the project, said: \u201cThe use we see for this is pollination in green houses.

The best strategy is increasing the number of allotments, the report says. Planting preferred flowers in gardens also helps, as does mowing grass in public parks less frequently, allowing flowers to bloom.</p> <p>Allotments are particularly good places for pollinators because they provide a mix of fruit and vegetable flowers, plus weedy corners full of native plants. \u201cAllotments are incredibly important at a city level, despite their small area,\u201d said Katherine Baldock at the University of Bristol, who led the research. \u201cThey are a good place for pollinators to hang out and provide a win-win situation, as they are also good for food growing and for people\u2019s health.\u201d</p> <p>The research, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-018-0769-y\">published in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution</a>, found allotments and gardens often had 10 times more bees than parks, cemeteries and urban nature reserves. Baldock said nature reserves were important for other wildlife but were often less suitable for pollinators, being dominated by trees rather than meadows.</p> <p>The scientists also identified the flowers most visited by bees, hoverflies and other pollinators. Native favourites included brambles, buttercups, dandelions, creeping thistle, common hogweed and ox-eye daisies. \u201cPeople tend to think of these as weeds, but they are really important for pollinators,\u201d said Baldock.</p> <p>She said gardeners had an important role to play in pollinator conservation, with the non-native plants that attracted the most pollinators being lavender, borage, butterfly bushes and common marigolds. Hydrangeas and forget-me-nots were among the least favourite. The researchers found that gardens in more affluent neighbourhoods harboured more pollinators, thanks to there being more flowers and a richer variety of plants.</p> <p>Stephanie Bird, of the Royal Horticultural Society, said: \u201cThis new paper shows that gardens are a hugely important resource for pollinators in urban areas. We would encourage the UK\u2019s 27 million gardeners to pack in a variety of plants, as not all pollinators can access the nectar of each plant, and consider introducing plants to bloom across all seasons.\u201d The RHS is now working with the University of Bristol to find which plants produce the most nectar.</p> <p>Gardens cover between a quarter and a third of cities, far more than allotments, which cover less than 1%.

The biggest gains were in semi-arid climates, where pumpkin yields rose 561%, aubergine 364%, broad bean 177% and melons 56%. In areas with adequate rain, tomato harvests doubled and aubergine went up 250%. In mountain fields, courgette production tripled and pumpkins doubled.</p> <p>In another <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901118306105\">study</a>, which is funded by the German environment ministry, Christmann will test a five-year plan to move from work with small pilot projects to large scale producers by inserting flowering strips of canola and other marketable crops to break up monocultures.</p> <p>She also hopes to see changes in national landscape policies. Working with tourist, agriculture and communication ministries, she aims to raise awareness of the economic benefits of wild pollinators and to encourage more planting of wildflowers, berry bushes and flowering trees.</p> <p>\u201cThe entire environment would be richer, more beautiful and more resilient to climate change,\u201d said the bee evangelist. \u201cWe would have many more insects, flowers and birds.

Currently, there are only 24 countries in this \u201ccoalition of the willing\u201d, mostly from Europe. Eventually, she hopes there will be enough support to multilateral environmental agreement on pollinators similar to the international convention on trade in endangered species. \u201cI hope this week\u2019s conference will be the first step to bringing a multilateral agreement into being because that\u2019s what we need,\u201d she says.</p> <p>She expects resistance from agrichemical companies. \u201cI think Monsanto won\u2019t like this because they want to sell their pesticides and this approach reduces pests naturally,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Christmann is used to adversity.

As inventors find new uses for the versatile material, demand is growing a hefty 18% per year. The use of nanocellulose for packaging and construction can help remove carbon dioxide, a primary contributor to climate change, from the atmosphere, and reduce demand for environment-harming plastics. But it could also increase pressure to turn diverse forests into plantations bereft of biodiversity, and otherwise disrupt habitat.</p> <p><strong>Forests as fuel</strong></p> <p>The European Union has adopted a directive classifying wood as a renewable energy source and has plans to dramatically increase renewables\u2019 share of the energy mix by 2030. Ironically, these moves are spurring actions that are seen as detrimental from both climate change and biodiversity perspectives: The import of wood into the EU from countries such as the US and Canada has increased in recent years and there are concerns for disruption of forest habitat in Europe as well. A lawsuit is challenging the classification but the problem could worsen if countries outside the EU follow suit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a50eac6eab210ea5a667a80578cd47fea98ae934\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a50eac6eab210ea5a667a80578cd47fea98ae934/0_0_5000_3347/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The import of wood from Canada\u2019s forests has increased.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"669\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The import of wood from Canada\u2019s forests has increased.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wolfgang Kaehler/LightRocket/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Better buds for bees?</strong></p> <p>Bees and other pollinators have been in big trouble lately as changing land use and perils such as pesticides and disease decimate their populations. Recent research in the US has shown that pollen of sunflowers and relatives, though not as nutritionally valuable as pollen from other plants, appears to reduce the severity of a gut infection that decreases reproductive success in bumblebees. If this research were to lead to mass plantings of sunflowers, it could adversely affect other wild bees that depend on more nutritious plants or on host-parasite interactions to thrive.</p> <p><strong>Long-horned trouble</strong></p> <p>The Asian long-horned tick arrived in the US in 2017, bringing a most unwelcome guest: a bacterium that kills cattle. The tick tolerates a wide range of conditions and has potential to spread along the coasts of North America as well as into Central and South America, carrying its deadly companion along with it. This duo is likely to catalyse changes in land use as cattle growers adjust their operations. Because the tick has been known to infest mammals and birds, there is concern it may also harm wildlife as it spreads.</p> <p><strong>Disappearing kelp</strong></p> <p>Large \u201cforests\u201d of kelp, a type of brown algae, grow along coastlines around the world, protecting shores from erosion and sheltering commercially important fish and other ocean life. Despite their reputation for enduring environmental stress, many of these kelp forests have been declining in recent years, possibly due to rising ocean temperatures, pollution, harvesting and non-native species. Further declines could disrupt ocean ecosystems and result in economically impactful losses of the billions of dollars worth of services they provide to humans.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"49aab919d910e8efac24dca8f7aeb7f675334eb7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49aab919d910e8efac24dca8f7aeb7f675334eb7/0_0_5176_3432/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fish swim in a kelp forest in the Indian Ocean\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fish swim in a kelp forest in the Indian Ocean.

What\u2019s less common knowledge, and only gradually being understood by scientists, is how the ozone hole over the Antarctic affects this. The hole in Earth\u2019s ozone layer has been shrinking due to reduced emissions of pollutants that cause it to enlarge. This alteration could contribute to changes in wind and other weather patterns over the south pole. The changing weather in turn is likely to cause more Antarctic ice to melt, exacerbating global sea-level rise and further threatening coastal communities and habitat.</p> <p><strong>Mini hydro meets river ecology</strong></p> <p>Small hydropower dams are becoming increasingly popular for powering local communities in Asia and elsewhere. Though they can have less land use impact than megadams, they still disrupt river flow and sediment movement and so can alter habitat in ways that affect animals and plants that inhabit rivers and streams. With more than 80,000 such dams in existence and a development push for more, there is a need for a better understanding of potential ecological impacts and what we can do to minimise harm to fish and other living things.</p> <p><strong>Circular aquaculture</strong></p> <p>Ocean <a href=\"https://ensia.com/features/us-offshore-aquaculture/\">fish farming</a> can produce large amounts of food but it takes a lot of water and can pollute the environment with nutrients and other chemicals. One approach being explored to reduce adverse impacts is the use of recirculating aquaculture systems, which reduce water demand by 97%\u201399%. Limiting factors for this approach are the cost, as well as concerns about the downsides such as feed sourcing and energy use. If these factors are addressed, farms could help boost ocean fish supply in a more sustainable manner than conventional approaches.</p> <p><strong>Mosquito-murdering fungi</strong></p> <p>As conventional insecticides such as pyrethroids become less effective at killing malaria-carrying mosquitoes due to the evolution of resistance, scientists are searching for innovative alternatives. One recently developed is a mosquito-infecting fungus that has been genetically engineered to produce a toxin found in spider venom.

Although still in its early stages, such a device could potentially be used to increase reproductive capacity of endangered mammals in instances where the availability of females to gestate the next generation is a limiting factor to recovery. Yet to be explored are possible behavioural and immune system implications and other unintended consequences of bypassing the mother\u2019s natural accommodations.</p> <p><strong>Asian cures, biodiversity ills</strong></p> <p>Traditional Asian medicine is flying high these days with inclusion in the World Health Assembly\u2019s International Classification of Diseases in early 2019, a growing market push by the Chinese government, and booming sales in countries involved in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/ng-interactive/2018/jul/30/what-china-belt-road-initiative-silk-road-explainer\">China\u2019s Belt and Road initiative</a>. Whether or not that\u2019s good for human health, implications for endangered species are a concern because some treatments require harvesting threatened species. Not only that but the Belt and Road development could enhance access to hard-to-reach sources of such species, further increasing opportunities to harvest high-demand plants and animals.</p> <p><strong>Mystery blockchain</strong></p> <p>The distributed tracking technology known as <a href=\"https://ensia.com/features/blockchain-environment-sustainability/\">blockchain</a> is finding an increasingly broad array of applications, including managing energy and other natural resources. With no universal standards or oversight, however, it opens to door to disconcerting applications such as a Germany-based demonstration in which a forest was essentially empowered to sell its own timber. The lack of convention and regulation could create impacts on biodiversity outside of existing political and regulatory structures. At the same time, the technology could be used to improve governance of natural resources, protect indigenous land rights and more.</p> <p><strong>CSI: environment</strong></p> <p>Is harming the environment a crime? Under the Rome Statute, the international criminal court can hold individuals and governments responsible for destroying natural resources in certain situations. Efforts are under way, however, to extend the definition of prosecutable crime beyond the limits of the statute to include ecocide \u2013 harm to the environment that affect the ability of those who live there to peaceably coexist with it. Several initiatives are moving toward this goal, with potential for making common activities such as producing greenhouse gases and destroying habitat prosecutable under international law.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8b3f9c710c78a8590ecf631b8790ce81fefd81c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b3f9c710c78a8590ecf631b8790ce81fefd81c5/0_0_3500_2334/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An Extinction Rebellion protest in Dublin, Ireland.

The <a href=\"https://www.bonnchallenge.org/content/challenge\" title=\"\">2011 Bonn challenge</a> aims to bring 350m hectares (864.5m acres) of degraded land into restoration by 2030, and countries have already signed up 170m hectares. A impressive number of sometimes surprising countries have increased their forest cover by more than 20% over the last 25 years: China, Belarus, Chile, France, Greece, India, Iran, Morocco, the Philippines, Spain, Thailand and Turkey.

Argentina, for example, has committed to planting 1m hectares, but meanwhile the ancient Gran Chaco in the north continues to vanish, replaced by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/26/soy-destruction-deforestation-in-argentina-leads-straight-to-our-dinner-plates\" title=\"\">huge fields of soy</a> to feed the farm animals of the world.</p> <p>Cameroon, which holds part of the precious Congo basin rainforest, is offering to create 12m hectares of tree cover by 2030, but since 1990 more than 20% of Cameroon\u2019s forests have been cut down to make way for subsistence farmers and now, increasingly, for banana and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/feb/19/palm-oil-ingredient-biscuits-shampoo-environmental\" title=\"\">palm oil plantations</a>, to create products that end up in our supermarket shopping baskets. Nigeria may feel better about itself after pledging to plant a million hectares, but the fact is that over the last 25 years it has lost more than 10 times that amount, more than half its forests. For a number of years it even had the highest deforestation rate in the world, but it was <a href=\"https://www.rainforesttrust.org/ghana-lost-over-half-of-its-rainforest-in-2018-rainforest-trust-refuge-expansion-will-combat-further-deforestation/\" title=\"\">overtaken</a> this year by Ghana, where cocoa bean crops for our chocolate are replacing the rainforests.</p> <p>And let\u2019s not dwell too long on the countries where the rate of loss is just as high and dramatic but are not even bothering to sign up to Bonn such as Bolivia (80,000 square kilometres gone between 1990 and 2015), North Korea (33,000), Paraguay (58,000) and Indonesia (a breathtaking 275,000km\u2072 \u2013 an area larger than New Zealand).</p> <p>Even the apparently cheering news that global tree cover is growing is less than it seems, explains Tim Rayden,who works for the Wildlife Conservation Society, part of the Trillion Trees partnership. \u201cThere is a big difference between tree cover and forests.\u201d A large number of countries, for example, are planning to fill their commitments with commercial plantations \u2013 but plantations, which are harvested every 10 years or more regularly, are very much less effective than tropical forests at capturing carbon. He points to <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01026-8\" title=\"\">recent research</a> where scientists worked out the carbon capture potential of three different reforestation scenarios under the terms of the Bonn challenge.

At the <a href=\"https://gardenmuseum.org.uk/the-museum/\" title=\"g\">Garden Museum</a> in London, where I\u2019m head gardener, I despaired as hedges browned, ferns scorched and even our toughest perennials wilted. Thankfully, a wet winter had bolstered Thames Water\u2019s reserves. A hosepipe ban would have been fatal for many plants. With the exception, that is, of one stalwart: tree echiums (<em>Echium pininana</em>), whose cheerful revelry amid such arid conditions lifted my spirits.</p> <p>For more than a decade, nestled against a west-facing wall and baked in afternoon sunshine, tree echiums have regularly flowered and set seed in a quiet corner of the museum gardens. I\u2019ve always been fond of their towering blue flower spikes, which lift magnificently from crowns of bristly, lanceolate leaves, but only last year came to appreciate their suitability for Britain\u2019s warming climate. I believe their popularity will increase significantly in coming years. These plants deliver, both for the gardener \u2013 in ease of cultivation and floral splendour \u2013 and for struggling pollinators, too, more of which later.</p> <p>Commonly known as bugloss, echiums are true sun-lovers, hailing from the baking climes of the Mediterranean and North Africa. Armed with heat-protective foliage and questing taproots, they flourish in dry weather, emerging among sunlit rocks like basking adders after hibernation. A large number of their 40-plus species hail from the subtropical Macaronesian archipelagos, occupying the dusty volcanic slopes of the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands. These scattered isles are home to spectacular echium forms: flower-clustered shrubs and giant pillars bursting with colour, many unique to single islands, such as Tenerife\u2019s <em>E</em><em> wildpretii</em>, appropriately named the \u201cTower of Jewels\u201d for its beguiling 3m (10ft) blooms. During the great plant-hunting era of the late 18th century, the Scottish botanist Francis Masson visited Macaronesia, writing enthusiastically back to Kew Gardens of \u201ctremendous ravines\u201d abounding with rare plants. One can only imagine the delight at Kew, as gardeners unwrapped Masson\u2019s fresh-off-the-boat samples of <em>E</em><em> candicans</em>, whose purple-blue spires give even delphiniums a run for their money.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"92583a1165ca6603efbb0241036223fcdfc89249\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92583a1165ca6603efbb0241036223fcdfc89249/0_245_3168_3960/800.jpg\" alt=\"Red bugloss (Echium wildpretii) growing in Tenerife\u2019s Mount Teide national park\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tower of jewels: <em>Echium wildpretii</em> growing in Tenerife\u2019s Mount Teide national park.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BriBar/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Echiums vary greatly between annuals, hardy perennials and semi-evergreens. Favoured garden varieties tend to be the monocarpic sort; producing leaf mounds in their first year and flowering in the second or third, before setting seed and dying. Almost all species, however, are united by a few defining attributes: showy compound flowers of white, pink, red or blue; narrow, hirsute leaves; and tough, wandering stems. Horticulturally, their needs are simple \u2013 a poor substrate, a sunny spot and a dose of neglect. For gardeners on chalky or sandy soil, therefore, we\u2019re talking drought-tolerant plants that produce long-lasting blooms that thrive when all but ignored. For those on heavier soil, there is the option of a pot, filled with gritty, free-draining compost and manoeuvred into a sunny position.</p> <p>Ah, you say, but these are not the winter-less wilds of subtropical Tenerife. Indeed, so protection is necessary during the cold season. Echiums can handle temperatures down to -5C, but will not tolerate damp. To avoid rot, which can be deadly, protect vulnerable plants from frost with a light fleece, removing when the sun shines to maintain airflow. Alternatively, they may be transplanted to a pot (bucket-sized will do) and brought indoors for winter. Even bulky tree echiums will lift with surprising ease and, provided the ordeal is kept brief, recover well when replanted the following spring.</p> <p>This sensitivity to cold has precipitated a misconception that echiums may only be grown on the Cornish coast or within the shielded microclimates of central London. Not so: I know of echiums growing happily in western Scotland and north Wales; from Nottingham to Northumberland. In fact, the <a href=\"http://www.echiumworld.co.uk/\" title=\"\">UK\u2019s National Echium Collection</a> (echiumworld.co.uk) resides not in the sunny south but the east Midlands, outside Newark-on-Trent. \u201cThey are wonderful plants and easier to grow than people think,\u201d says Linda Heywood, the collection\u2019s founder. \u201cThey don\u2019t need feeding or staking, and self-seed prolifically.\u201d She sows seeds on to multipurpose compost indoors throughout spring and early summer, before covering with vermiculite. \u201cAll echiums must be handled with gloves,\u201d she says, \u201cas the coarse hairs can cause skin irritation. But that\u2019s a small price for their flowers.\u201d</p> <p>So, to pollinator appeal: if you have grown borage or comfrey, you\u2019ll have witnessed their supreme magnetism for bees and butterflies. Echiums belong to the same plant family, <em>Boraginaceae</em>, and share that trait. As average monthly temperatures rise, our spring flowers are blooming ever earlier, making nectar sources for pollinators \u2013 including the declining honeybee \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2019/mar/26/uk-pollinating-insects-survey-losers-and-winners-in-pictures\" title=\"\">increasingly uncertain</a> during early summer. Echiums bridge that gap, delivering floral profusion in late May that often continues well into July and August, unflustered by extreme heat. London\u2019s Natural History Museum recently planted new displays to showcase plants that will be better able to withstand climate change, and provide a much-needed food source for pollinating insects. Needless to say, echiums feature prominently.</p> <p>Convinced? I hope so: an echium in the right place will offer all the splendour of a thirsty phlox for a fraction of the watering demand. And while the thrill of exotic plants is no compensation for climate change, let\u2019s make hay while the sun shines, if only for the sake of our bees.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1affc68129c705b7220b39183b7660416146cbc7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1affc68129c705b7220b39183b7660416146cbc7/0_214_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Britain\u2019s native Echium vulgare grows on wastelands and dry grassland, such as these at Dungeness\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Britain\u2019s native <em>Echium vulgare </em>grows on wastelands and dry grassland, such as these at Dungeness.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Turp/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Five echiums to enjoy</h2> <p><strong>1 </strong><em>Echium candicans</em>: for multiple flowers.

The tax on pesticides is a sound idea, which could then be used to fund specific circumstances. As a farm manager in the 1970s in Essex, I would observe swarms of aphids feeding on the winter wheat crop. They had blown on an easterly wind from the near continent.</p> <p>It was easy to apply an aphicide to the wheat, but in reality it was an insecticide. This did considerable harm to the hives of bees placed on the headlands of the beanfields to pollinate the crop. The person operating the sprayer also ended up with a thumping headache.</p> <p>This was repeated on the Isle of Axholme. I was working as an agriculturalist in that terrible drought year of 1976. I recall the plague of ladybirds feeding on the aphids, and the complaints of the tourists bitten on the beaches. My advice to the farmers, at the time, was apply an aphicide to avoid loss of yield. It would have been ecologically sound if the farmers had been compensated for their estimated loss, tolerated the poor crop and not used the insecticide.

These are used to map the range of each species of bee and hoverfly over time. The data did not allow the assessment of numbers of insects, but some researchers think populations have fallen faster than range.</p> <p>Pollinating insects are vital to human food security, as three-quarters of crops depend on them. They are also crucial to other wildlife, both as food and as pollinators of wild plants. \u201cThe declines in Britain can be viewed as a warning about the health of our countryside,\u201d said Gary Powney at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology in Wallingford, who led the research.</p> <p>He called for more volunteers to take part in the <a href=\"https://www.ceh.ac.uk/our-science/projects/pollinator-monitoring\">UK Pollinator Monitoring Scheme</a>: \u201cTheir contribution is vital for us to understand what is happening in our landscape.\u201d Another recent study found that allotments, weedy corners and fancy gardens can all be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/14/city-bees-allotments-gardens-help-arrest-decline-study\">urban havens for bees</a>.</p> <p>The biggest factor in the decline in pollinators is likely to be the destruction of wild habitats and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jun/29/pesticides-damage-survival-of-bee-colonies-landmark-study-shows\">use of pesticides</a> as farming has intensified.

But the lobe-spurred furrow bee, which was once rare, has expanded its range fivefold and is now considered an important crop pollinator in England.</p> <p>Powney said the increased range of the bees most commonly pollinating crops is good news and might be a result of more oilseed rape being grown, as well as wildflower margins being planted. But he also warned: \u201cThey are a relatively small group of species. Therefore, with species having declined overall, it would be risky to rely on this group to support the long-term food security for our country. If anything happens to them in the future there will be fewer other species to \u2018step up\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Prof Dave Goulson, at the University of Sussex and not part of the latest research, said: <strong>\u201c</strong>Previous studies have described declines in UK butterflies, moths, carabid beetles, bees and hoverflies \u2013 this new study confirms that declines in insects are ongoing.\u201d</p> <p>If the losses of upland and northern species are due to climate change, \u201cthen we can expect far more rapid declines of these species in the future, as climate change has barely got started\u201d, he said. Goulson also said the start of more rapid declines in southern bees after 2007 coincided with the first use of now-banned neonicotinoid pesticides.</p> <p>Roy van Grunsven, at the Dutch Butterfly Conservation project, said the decline in numbers of insects was very likely to be a lot higher than the shrinking of their range: \u201cGoing from flowery meadows full of bees to intensive agriculture with a few individuals in a road verge does not result in a change in distribution, but of course is a huge change in [numbers].\u201d</p> <p>Matt Shardlow, of the conservation charity Buglife, said unless the pesticide approval process was improved to help bee safety and green subsidies were targeted to create corridors that connect wild spaces, we can expect the declines to continue or worsen.</p>", "wordcount": "769"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2019/may/22/who-needs-flowers-the-garden-that-won-at-chelsea-is-still-blooming-impressive", "type": "article", "sectionId": "lifeandstyle", "sectionName": "Life and style", "webPublicationDate": "2019-05-22T17:12:44Z", "webTitle": "Who needs flowers?

To dramatically oversimplify for those who haven\u2019t yet seen it, Andy Sturgeon\u2019s M&amp;G Garden is half Midsomer and half Mad Max. And yet this simple garden design won best in show at the RHS Chelsea flower show yesterday. </p> <p>Not everyone is happy about this. First, say some, gardens need colour and variety. Second, there is the issue of nectar, or lack of it. Wildlife-friendly folk argue (correctly) that gardens need flowers to provide life-giving nectar for the bees and other invertebrates that are already in decline throughout the world. But there is more going on in this garden than you might realise at first.</p> <p>There is the design. The black rocks (apparently made from specially prepared oak) represent volcanic rocks that protrude from the ocean, giving the garden a barren, almost otherworldly, quality.</p> <p>Then there are the plants. There are lots of mosses, ferns and grasses \u2013 species able to colonise and eke out an existence in the most barren cracks and crannies on the planet. In fact, some of these plants go back 400m years. And, it turns out that there are flowers in this garden \u2013 it is just that many of them are in colours that might not grab our human eyes.</p> <p>Here is a garden that looks as if it playing by its own rules, which is what nature does best if we give it the time and the space. This is an important point that, perhaps, the garden\u2019s designer is trying to make. Many of the environmental crises that we are unleashing on the planet, particularly the current climate emergency, are in some way repairable by nature. As long we provide the space and the political willingness to curb some of our activities, nature has the tools to fix this place. Like plants that grow on volcanic rocks, nature can rebuild. Recolonise. Begin again. Nature is unthinkingly drawn towards succession. Nature can make a Midsomer out of a Mad Max.</p> <p>Could this garden be bettered?

Today in the UK, where more than three quarters of us live in cities, many people have lost touch with the natural world. They have forgotten the earth beneath their feet. Dave Goulson wants to reverse that dangerous trend and reconnect us with the wildlife that lives under our noses, in our gardens and parks: \u201cthe jungle that lurks just outside your back door\u201d.</p> <p>In the last 30 years, Goulson \u2013 a professor of biology who specialises in bumblebee ecology and founded the Bumblebee Conservation Trust \u2013 has had six different gardens, from \u201ca pocket-handkerchief rectangle\u201d to his current one, a \u201cslightly unkempt but delightful\u201d two acres. But every garden, large or small, is teeming with life, from the worms to the birds and butterflies. Beginning in the 1970s, Jennifer Owen \u2013 \u201cone of the great heroines of wildlife gardening\u201d \u2013 recorded the plants and creatures living in her little Leicester garden. In 35 years she found 2,673 species.</p> <p>Around the world, industrial farming and climate change are destroying natural environments and species at an alarming rate. Wildflower meadows used to cover much of lowland Britain: 7m acres of them in 1930s. Only 2% of these remain. Hedgehogs have declined in numbers by 50% in just the last 15 years. In parts of China, farmers now have to hand-pollinate fruit trees because pesticides have wiped out the bees. In the UK, orchards are typically sprayed 26 times a year with insecticides, fungicides and other chemicals: \u201cthose rosy, shiny apples on the supermarket shelf got there as a result of environmental carnage\u201d. But Goulson\u2019s message is one of hope: we can all make a difference by having wildlife-friendly gardens. Packed with remarkable details about the roles played by such unexotic creatures as ants and earwigs, the book shows how anyone lucky enough to have a garden or an allotment can transform it into a refuge for threatened flora and fauna.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>From attracting pollinators to creating environments for bees to nest in, this is an excellent guide to green gardening</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Gardening to save the planet is not that difficult, Goulson assures us: grow a variety of flowers, such as foxgloves for long-tongued bumblebees and thyme for honeybees, honeysuckle for butterflies and even ivy (there\u2019s a species of bee that depends on it). Plant trees if you have the space. Don\u2019t overly tidy your garden \u2013 a pile of old logs is a haven for insects. Create a miniature wildflower meadow by not mowing part of your lawn. Compost your kitchen waste and never buy peat-based compost. Dig a pond: rural ponds have declined by 70% since 1890 and they support some of Britain\u2019s rarest animals. And never use pesticides or weedkillers.</p> <p>From the best flowers to grow for pollinators, to creating environments for bees to nest in, this is an excellent guide to green gardening: \u201cIf you really want to leave your grandchildren a healthy planet to live on, it\u2019s time to get out in the garden and dig.\u201d</p> <p><em> \u2022 The Garden Jungle: or Gardening to Save the Planet by Dave Goulson is published by Cape (RRP \u00a316.99).

It is a question asked a lot at the moment, given the apparent population explosion in recent weeks, and the webs lacing our outdoor spaces. But actually, they\u2019ve been here since early spring, as tiny 1mm spiderlings, from eggs deposited under a silken protective igloo last autumn. At this time of year, they are reaching adult maturity \u2013 finally big enough to be noticed.</p> <p>This year\u2019s warm summer has been kind to spiders, giving them plenty of invertebrate food (mostly flies, but also bees, wasps, butterflies and beetles), and a temperature that speeds up their growth.</p> <p>So what should you look our for in your garden? Ubiquitous is the garden spider, <em>Araneus diadematus</em>, named after the diadem-like markings on its abdomen. Britain\u2019s largest species is the <em>Araneus quadratus</em>, a great blob of a spider almost as big as a walnut, marked with four pale egg-shaped dots on its abdomen. </p> <p>Spiders are good to have around. After birds, they are the most important predators of insects, and a cornerstone of the natural balance that usually keeps nuisance blow-flies, houseflies and greenbottles at bay. A healthy spider population is also a good indicator of a healthy insect fauna in the area.</p> <p>They are also masters of engineering; each will build a web combining up to 20 metres of silk, welded at more than 1,000 joints as the sticky spiral net is laid across 30-40 radiating spokes. And although the total web weighs only half a milligram, it is capable of supporting more than 4,000 times its weight. It is a truly glorious sight. As autumn dews start to settle, with cooler weather to come, the webs become even more picturesque.</p> <p>So how can you make your garden more spider-friendly? Think about the open space that spiders like to build their webs across: hedges, fence posts, bushes, tall plants or draped on a clematis thicket. And, crucially, try to leave them be. They have an annual life cycle and will start to disappear when the winter cold arrives, so enjoy them while you can.<br><em>Richard Jones is an entomologist and naturalist, and a writer on science, nature and the environment.

That was the question on my mind back in January. The weather was exceptionally mild and I was mowing the one remaining patch of grass in a garden that had been all lawn when we bought the house nine years ago. Last summer, the same sward was brown and apparently lifeless during the heatwave. That is the problem with a monoculture \u2013 if the prevailing conditions don\u2019t suit it, there are no backups. Except that my lawn, spared from weedkiller, was not a true monoculture. Apart from different species of grasses, there were large patches of clover, which relished the heat; unmown, they flowered freely, fuelling countless bees. It was the clover that prompted me to lose my lawn completely.</p> <p>We are very attached to our lawns and can be obsessive about maintaining them as finely textured, evenly green carpets. A whole industry is built on turf insecurities \u2013 mosskillers, weedkillers, fertilisers, not to mention treatments for \u201cdiseases\u201d such as chafer grubs, red thread and fairy rings. Drought and rain also challenge the holy grail of the perfect lawn. But there are alternatives. From a gravel garden or a massed planting scheme to an outdoor \u201croom\u201d, you can lose your lawn and recreate its open space without resorting to sterile decking or paving. Here are five ways to do this.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f7ca2b183fbc3b4ba7e150b0bdbeb54b37ab3c96\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7ca2b183fbc3b4ba7e150b0bdbeb54b37ab3c96/0_97_3280_4098/800.jpg\" alt=\"A gravel path\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Mediterranean plants will thrive among the sun-baked stones.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Ingram/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Up the garden path</strong></h2> <p>A gravel garden achieves a similar effect to a lawn and affords more opportunity for routes through and relaxing spaces within the planting. It needs a sunny site and, if the underlying soil does not drain freely, you must incorporate plenty of grit. This is a case of spreading gravel, chippings or small stones over the bare topsoil to a depth of about 5cm and planting into that, ensuring the rootballs make contact with the soil below; add extra soil in the planting hole if necessary. Many Mediterranean plants will thrive among the sun-baked stones: think thymes, santolinas and <em>Verbena bonariensis, </em>with annuals, such as poppies and love-in-a-mist, scattered between to fill gaps while the garden is getting established. A mixture of carpeting, hummock and vertical shapes creates interest on different levels. Gravel is a great substrate for self-seeding, so this alternative tends to evolve of its own accord, with some editing from the gardener.</p> <h2><strong>Steppe </strong><strong>it up</strong></h2> <p>Cutting your grass less frequently will result in a much richer plant community but one that is essentially native. As such, it will tend to lose visual appeal after midsummer. To create more of a show, we need to draw inspiration from further afield. The semi-arid grasslands \u2013 known as steppe \u2013 that cover huge tracts of Eurasia are rich in vegetation, ecologically diverse and the perfect inspiration for a British garden. It\u2019s easily achieved on a domestic scale, using a wide range of plants that enjoy similar conditions to create successional phases of foliage, flowers and seedheads. Early autumn is the time to strip a lawn of turf, cultivate to remove weed roots and plant a matrix of bulbs, such as crocuses, tulips and alliums, and perennials such as hardy geraniums, achilleas, <em>Lychnis coronaria</em>, kniphofias and crocosmias to give a kaleidoscope of colour next year. Add a few ornamental grasses such as <em>Melica ciliata</em> or <em>Stipa lessingiana</em> for their fine texture and movement.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d4f8f67c30bf212ecb79db7a88cc0979b0dc0e17\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d4f8f67c30bf212ecb79db7a88cc0979b0dc0e17/0_161_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steppe Planting\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steppe planting: plant up a matrix of bulbs, such as crocuses, tulips and alliums, and perennials to give a kaleidoscope of colour .</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Ingram/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Create a wildflower meadow</strong></h2> <p>The simplest way to diversify your lawn is to let most of it grow and see what ensues. The wildflowers endemic to your area (with the right mindset, no longer thought of as weeds) will be allowed to grow to their full height and flower. Low growers such as daisies and selfheal will be first to assert their presence, followed by taller dandelions and buttercups. The insect population will flourish. But you can\u2019t down tools completely. Keep some mown paths across the patch and around the edge for ease of human traffic, to keep a little crispness and indicate your meadow is intentional. The end of summer is the time to strim and then mow the sward \u2013 ungrazed pasture reverts to woodland in time. If your liberated lawn borders traditional flowerbeds, you may have to accept that, with more plants going to seed nearby, you need to hoe more often.</p> <h2><strong>Plant lavender </strong><strong>for bees</strong></h2> <p>In Provence, a magical garden created by the late Nicole de V\u00e9sian, a Herm\u00e8s textile designer, has a lavender field where, in a more northerly setting, you might expect to find a lawn. This is a monoculture but, unlike a manicured lawn, a very bee-friendly one, and the density of plants makes for a lovely perfume. Instead of mowing, there is regular hoeing between the rows and an annual trim at the end of summer. Dutch lavender, <em>Lavandula x intermedia</em>, is the most attractive to pollinating insects and more robust than English lavender. \u201cGrosso\u201d and \u201cGros Bleu\u201d are excellent.</p> <h2><strong>Take your inside out</strong></h2> <p>Part of a garden (or all of it, if it is tiny) can serve as an extension of our indoor living quarters. Non-porous hard landscaping can lead to problems with water run-off and flooding in urban areas, so better to go for the semi-permeable option of old-fashioned hoggin or self-binding gravel to form a stable surface, bound together by the tiny clay particles in the mix. You need to lay a hardcore base, then spread the gravel to a depth of 5cm and roll. The final sealing stage involves rolling again while spraying with water from a hose. The result is natural enough to support the odd weed or self-seeded plant, so some tidying up is needed here and there. Add tables, chairs and a mini-pond where birds can bathe and dragonflies and damselflies can breed. Plant bee-friendly herbs such as thyme, mint, marjoram and fennel. Espaliered fruit trees can form \u201cwalls\u201d and, along with pots of blueberries and salad crops, will provide you with a foraged supper.</p>", "wordcount": "981"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}, {"id": "environment/2019/may/04/the-battle-to-save-the-worlds-biggest-bumblebee-from-european-invaders", "type": "article", "sectionId": "environment", "sectionName": "Environment", "webPublicationDate": "2019-05-04T09:00:08Z", "webTitle": "The battle to save the world's biggest bumblebee from extinction | Alison Benjamin", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/04/the-battle-to-save-the-worlds-biggest-bumblebee-from-european-invaders", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2019/may/04/the-battle-to-save-the-worlds-biggest-bumblebee-from-european-invaders", "fields": {"byline": "Alison Benjamin", "body": "<p>The first time Jos\u00e9 Montalava saw the world\u2019s largest bumblebee he was six years old and visiting his grandfather\u2019s house in rural Chile. \u201cIt was in the tomato patch, a huge, loud, fluffy orange thing buzzing around.

Each year more than 2 million bumblebee colonies are exported from factories in Europe to greenhouses in more than 60 countries. These industrial bumblebees are bred and sold for their fantastic pollination skills: their plump, hairy bodies are perfect to shake the pollen of the male part of the plant to the female. This buzz pollination \u2013 so-called because of the sound it makes \u2013 can lead to a 30% increase in the yield of tomatoes, compared with pollination by hand, with a wand.</p> <p>Around the world the industrial bees travel, pollinating fruits and vegetables, including tomatoes, aubergines, peppers and blueberries. More than a third of the world\u2019s crop production is reliant on pollinators whose annual services are estimated to be worth up to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/26/decline-of-bees-poses-potential-risks-to-major-crops-says-un\">$577bn (\u00a3440bn) to the global economy</a>.</p> <p>But the growth of the bumblebee trade for agricultural pollination since the 1980s has been identified as one of the top emerging <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016953471630218X\">environmental issues</a> likely to affect global diversity. </p> <p>\u201cJust as European settlers accidentally wiped out native populations in the Americas with a host of European diseases such as measles, which they had no defences against, the European bumblebees can transmit pathogens that kill native bees,\u201d says Cecilia Smith-Ram\u00edrez, a researcher in pollination and bumblebees at the University de Los Lagos and Institute of Ecology and Biodiversity (IEB) in Chile.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b80d1ae0723d94e61f9f7c5241c04170afeadb00\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b80d1ae0723d94e61f9f7c5241c04170afeadb00/0_0_1820_1247/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Bombus dahlbomii can be recognised by its golden fur.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"685\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The <em>Bombus dahlbomii</em>, known in Chile as the <em>moscard\u00f3n.</em></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Orlando Montes</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since 1997, Chile has imported more than 1.2m bumblebee colonies from factories in Belgium, Slovakia and Israel.

Over the years, they have escaped the greenhouses and spread more than 2,000km (1,200 miles) to the southernmost tip of South America, across the Andes into Argentina and from the Pacific to the Atlantic coast.</p> <p>The most widely exported European bumblebee is the buff-tailed bumblebee <em>(Bombus terrestris).</em> It is a common visitor to many gardens across the UK where it has been voted the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/16/buff-tailed-bumblebee-voted-britains-favourite-insect\">nation\u2019s favourite insect</a>. But this highly adaptable bumblebee can wreak havoc on non-native ecosystems. Six parasites have been identified on the bee and it competes for nesting sites and food with local bumblebees and other native pollinators, such as humming birds, damaging the propagation of native plants. It also boosts the spread of invasive plants, originally from Europe, suppressing the growth of local flora on which local birds and mammals feed. </p> <p>Huge public pressure mounted in Chile.

For them it carries the spirit of the dead, so they will never kill it.\u201d But although the Chilean government recognised the bee as endangered, nothing is being done, says Montalava, to stop Chilean farmers importing the European bumblebees.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"738efd6bb6cb1385dc565e3c2efddf0db2ddebf3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/738efd6bb6cb1385dc565e3c2efddf0db2ddebf3/0_0_5120_3413/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A box of bumblebees, ready to pollinate strawberries\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A box of bumblebees, ready to pollinate strawberries.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Arterra/UIG via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere is clear and mounting evidence of severe environmental costs of this bumblebee invasion,\u201d says Smith-Ram\u00edrez, who is leading a group of South American scientists preparing to sue the Chilean authorities. \u201cWe are developing a legal complaint against the agricultural and livestock service (SAG) for allowing the continued importation of non-native bumblebees when there are evident dangers to our native bumblebee and our ecosystems.\u201d</p> <p>In 2016, the <a href=\"https://www.ipbes.net/\">Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) </a>\u2013 a UN body set up to assess the state of global ecosystems and biodiversity \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.ipbes.net/assessment-reports/pollinators\">concluded </a>that there was enough evidence for \u201cdiscouraging introduction of non-native pollinator species\u201d.</p> <p>Biobest, one of the leading exporters of commercially bred European bumblebees, based in Belgium, has admitted that in hindsight Chile should not have imported buff-tailed bumblebees.</p> <p>\u201cThe decision at the time has not been the right choice,\u201d Jean-Marc Vandoorne, chief executive of the Biobest Group, has said. But 20 years on, he <a href=\"https://www.biobestgroup.com/en/news/south-american-bumblebee-story-makes-news-headlines-and-biobest\">doesn\u2019t agree with a ban</a>. \u201cIn our opinion, stopping production and importation today will not help the recovery of [the giant golden bumblebee] populations.\u201d</p> <p>Yet it could threaten many more of the 26 bumblebee species native to South America. The invaders are expected to spread north to Bolivia, Peru, and Uruguay, as well as further east to the Argentine Pampas and into southern Brazil, where a group of scientists have already <a href=\"http://abelhaprocurada.com.br/\">raised the alarm</a>.</p> <p>In Japan, where the buff-tailed bumblebee was first imported in 1991, two of its 22 native bumblebee species have <a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4450/10/2/59/htm\">suffered competition </a>from the newcomer. In 2006, the Japanese listed it as a major invasive species and further introductions are not allowed without permission from the Japanese ministries of agriculture and the environment.</p> <p>In Argentina, the government\u2019s attempts to keep out European bumblebees by banning imports has <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/304784375_Alien_parasite_hitchhikes_to_Patagonia_on_invasive_bumblebee\">proved futile</a>. \u201cThese bumblebees have no respect for national borders and their invasion could have significant conservation consequences across South America, so their introduction must be discouraged in regions with their own native bumblebees,\u201d warns Marina Arbetman, researcher at the National Scientific and Technical Research Council, in Argentina.</p> <p>Scientists want European companies and governments to take responsibility. \u201cThe problem begins in Europe where the companies that produce buff-tailed bumblebees are causing this global biodiversity catastrophe; they have ethical and internationally legal responsibilities,\u201d says Smith-Ram\u00edrez.

It can be a surprisingly dull moment in the garden, with all the yellowing leaves of tulips among the tired aquilegias. But the spires of foxgloves unfurl to raise your eye away from the dying back below. Combined with ferns, astrantias, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/apr/27/plant-offer-white-dusky-cranesbill\" title=\"\">dusky cranesbills</a> and cultivated cow parsley, <em>Anthriscus sylvestris</em> \u2018Ravenswing\u2019, they make the most of dappled shade and please the bees with it.</p> <p>This moment is long gone. In fact, many will now be setting seed. If you don\u2019t have your own plants, this is the moment to start sowing. Digitalis sown in the next month or so will bulk up before autumn and be ready to plant out next spring.</p> <p>They are surprisingly easy to grow from seed, for a fraction of the cost of mature plants. If you have the common foxglove, <em><a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/5862/Digitalis-purpurea/Details\" title=\"\">Digitalis purpurea</a></em>, tap it as you pass by and it will scatter itself where it pleases. If, however, you want to sow some of the many and glorious cultivars, or try your hand at some of the perennial foxgloves, you will need to buy seed.</p> <p>Digitalis seed is tiny and needs light to germinate. Whether you are scattering in the garden or on to a seed tray, it is very important the seed does not get buried. With seed trays, it is best to pre-water and then sow on top. Gently press the seeds into the damp compost and leave the trays somewhere bright, but slightly shaded. Seed germinates between 15C and 18C, but if the seed tray is left in full sun, the temperatures may soar and scorch the germinating seedlings. Seeds should germinate in 14 days. When they are large enough to handle, prick them out into modules or 9cm pots.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jun/29/weed-wildlife-friendly-way\">How to weed in a wildlife-friendly way | Alys Fowler</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Go for <em>D.</em><em> purpurea</em> and the lovely, pure-white <em><a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/63478/i-Digitalis-purpurea-i-f-i-albiflora-i/Details\" title=\"\">D.</a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/63478/i-Digitalis-purpurea-i-f-i-albiflora-i/Details\" title=\"\"> purpurea forma</a></em><a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/63478/i-Digitalis-purpurea-i-f-i-albiflora-i/Details\" title=\"\"> \u2018Albiflora\u2019</a> \u2013 or, if you want both colours, <em><a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/136477/i-Digitalis-purpurea-i-Pam-s-Choice/Details\" title=\"\">D.</a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/136477/i-Digitalis-purpurea-i-Pam-s-Choice/Details\" title=\"\"> purpurea</a></em><a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/136477/i-Digitalis-purpurea-i-Pam-s-Choice/Details\" title=\"\"> \u2018</a><a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/136477/i-Digitalis-purpurea-i-Pam-s-Choice/Details\" title=\"\">Pam\u2019s Choice\u2019</a>, with its white flowers and purple insides. <em>D.</em><em> purpurea</em> and cultivars are biennial, so they need to be sown or allowed to self-seed every year, so there is a fresh batch next spring.

In the months leading up to the bee crisis, clothianidin, developed by Bayer Crop Science from a class of insecticides called neonicotinoids, had been used up and down the Rhine following an outbreak of corn rootworm. The pesticide is designed to attack the nervous system of crop-munching pests, but studies have shown it can be harmful to insects such as the European honeybee. It muddles the bees\u2019 super-acute sense of direction and upsets their feeding habits, while it <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/srep14621\" title=\"\">can also alter</a> the queen\u2019s reproductive anatomy and sterilise males. As contaminated beehives piled up, Bayer paid \u20ac2m (\u00a31.76m) into a compensation fund for beekeepers in the affected area, but offered no admission of guilt.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/bee-emergency-unexplained-mass-die-off-hits-german-hives-a-552556.html\" title=\"\">The die-off</a> forced a reckoning among European farmers. Hundreds of studies examined the safety of neonicotinoids, known as neonics, and their links to colony collapse disorder (CCD), in which worker bees abandon the hive, leaving the queen and her recent offspring unprotected, to starve. In 2013, the evidence led to a landmark European commission ruling, imposing a moratorium on clothianidin and two other major neonics \u2013 the world\u2019s most popular pesticides. This April, Europe went a step further. The commission extended the ban on the trio of neonics to virtually everywhere outside greenhouses, citing evidence that by harming pollinating insects, neonics interfere with the <a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-18-3989_en.htm\" title=\"\">pollination of crops to the value of \u20ac15bn</a> a year. Environmentalists cheered the victory. Regulators beyond Europe plan to follow.</p> <p>For Haefeker at the beekeepers association, who had spent years campaigning against the use of neonics, victory was sweet, but short-lived: faced with multiple threats from modern farming methods, beekeepers know the insecticide ban alone is not enough to save the honeybee.</p> <p>Honeybees originated in Eurasia roughly 35m years ago, and as long as they have had steady access to flowering plants, they have thrived. But in the modern world, bees face all kinds of dangers. <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/3/CA0103EN/ca0103en.pdf\" title=\"\">Colony collapse</a> is not a single malady, but rather an amalgamation of different challenges. Alongside the dangers of pesticides, diseases such as Israeli acute paralysis virus, gut parasites and invasive parasites such as the varroa mite can overwhelm the bees\u2019 immune systems. Industrial agriculture imposes its own threats: a mania for monocultures has led to shrinking foraging habitats, while, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency, bees employed in commercial pollination, in which hives are stacked high on trucks and driven around the country to pollinate almond trees and other crops, get highly stressed, which damages their resilience and eating habits.</p> <p>Since the EU began phasing out neonics, in 2014, the honeybees\u2019 recovery has not been as dramatic as hoped. Neonics are probably not the biggest factor in the demise of bees, but they are the easiest to outlaw. To farmers, this seems outrageously unfair. Citing an industry-funded study, they say the ban will cost the EU agriculture sector \u20ac880bn annually in diminished crop yields.</p> <p>Another, more controversial, response to the slump in bee populations is in the works. This is the plan to create a more resilient strain of honeybee \u2013 a genetically modified superbee. The technology for creating GM honeybees is in its infancy, and still confined to the laboratory. But, if successful, it could lead to a hardier species, one that is resistant to natural and manmade hazards: viruses, varroa mites, pesticides and so on. If we can\u2019t change modern farming practices, the thinking goes, maybe we should change the bees.</p> <p>The prospect horrifies many bee people \u2013 from commercial beekeepers such as Haefeker to passionate amateurs \u2013 who see a lab-made superbee as a direct threat to the smaller, struggling bee species. Traditional beekeepers have a name for them that expresses their fear and suspicion: Frankenbees.</p> <p>Like many beekeepers, Haefeker is an activist and conservationist. A kind of bearded Lorax, Dr Seuss\u2019s valiant spokesman for threatened trees, Haefeker speaks for the bees. For much of the past two decades, he has sounded the alarm on declining bee health, bringing his message to lawmakers in Brussels, Berlin and Munich, before judges at the European court of justice in Luxembourg, to investor roundtables in London, to beekeeper conferences in Istanbul, Austria and Rome, and to corporate gatherings of the agrichemical industry around Europe.</p> <p>When we met in Bavaria a week after the EU extended its neonics ban, I expected Haefeker to be in celebratory mood. But over lunch at a favourite roadway tavern an hour outside Munich, he explained that he considers the development of GM bees \u2013 however long it takes to get them in production \u2013 an even greater threat to the humble honeybee. \u201cI don\u2019t expect it to be commercialised next week, but then I don\u2019t want to leave anything up to chance,\u201d Haefeker said. \u201cThe public has been pretty late on a whole bunch of bad ideas. We don\u2019t want to be late on this one.\u201d</p> <p>Some beekeepers worry that, if the agriculture industry succeeds in building and patenting a blockbuster, mite-free, pesticide-proof superbee, it would dominate and destroy the vibrant local market in conventional bee strains. There are health fears, too: the sting of GM bees may introduce new allergy risks. And beekeepers are afraid they would not be able to protect the gene pool of traditional strains such as the beloved <em>Apis mellifera</em>, the scientific name for the European honeybee, against a dominant, pesticide resistant, lab-designed version.</p> <p>Jay Evans heads the bee research lab at the US Department of Agriculture, where they are looking at various threats to bee health. Designing a truly pesticide-resistant honeybee, a \u201cbulletproof bee\u201d, as Evans calls them, would \u201cthrow a lot of nature under the bus\u201d.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>It is always hive-like \u2013 30C and humid \u2013 in the narrow, windowless laboratory where genetically engineered honeybees are created on the campus of Heinrich Heine University in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany. One June day, three students in T-shirts were on the morning shift. Two of them silently inspected plastic honeycomb discs. Each disc contained 140 tiny plug holes, in each of which a single honeybee embryo was growing. These discs were then passed to a third student at a separate workstation, where, with remarkable dexterity, she injected each egg with an sgRNA gene-manipulation solution, a main ingredient in a revolutionary new gene-editing technique called Crispr-Cas9.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jan/15/gene-editing-and-what-it-really-means-to-rewrite-the-code-of-life\" title=\"\">Crispr technology</a> has transformed microbiology in recent years by allowing scientists to copy a desirable part of the DNA strand and insert it directly into the chromosome of the target specimen. Now, with great precision, scientists can remove harmful mutations or unwanted traits, or insert a desired trait. In the US, you can buy a Crispr <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/genetically-modified-browning-resistant-apple-reaches-u-s-stores/\" title=\"\">apple that doesn\u2019t brown</a>.

In 2003, Beye and his colleagues were the first to pinpoint the gene variants, or alleles, that determine the sex of honeybees. Three years later (coincidentally, just as scientists determined the likely causes of colony collapse disorder), Beye and an international team of biologists decoded the <em>Apis mellifera</em> honeybee genome, a breakthrough that transformed the field of bee biology. Scientists now have an understanding of bee health down to the chromosomal level, enabling them, for example, to analyse precisely how pathogens and parasites affect their bee hosts. Genomics can take much of the guesswork out of breeding, too, revealing the precise gene markers that make stocks more resilient to stressors and disease. Once the genome was cracked, it was only a matter of time before the scientific community would build a designer bee. In 2014, Beye\u2019s lab claimed that crown.</p> <p>The gene-injection method Beye\u2019s team pioneered, and laid out in their <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/111/24/9003\" title=\"\">2014 research paper</a>, is painstaking and fraught with risk. To demonstrate, a student motioned for me to peer into her microscope. The faint outline of a tiny needle and its intended target, the egg, came into focus. Magnified, the egg looked like a smooth grey balloon, the kind performers at children\u2019s parties tie into poodles and giraffes. Poke the egg at the wrong angle, or with too much pressure, or with an imprecise dosage, and it will pop. And the injection has to be stealthy enough to leave no marks. If the worker bees, the hive\u2019s fastidious caretakers, sense in any way the pupae are not perfect, they cast them from the nest, leaving them for dead. Only the pristine survive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e446e3990cd18e6cadd9933284f712d4a9a0c2ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e446e3990cd18e6cadd9933284f712d4a9a0c2ad/122_250_3463_2078/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Honey bees in flight, Germany, Europe\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Honey bees in flight.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andre Skonieczny/Getty/Imagebroker</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To increase the odds of success, Beye\u2019s team keep their injected embryos away from the workers at first, incubating in an artificial hive. Only after 72 hours do they slip the fittest of their modified larvae specimens into a queen-rearing colony. What happens next is similar to the conventional queen-breeding method. The researchers graft the larvae into cell cups lined with royal jelly, the nutrient rich compound that young larvae gorge on to become queens. Even so, the workers, on average, rejected three out of four mutant larvae. But the survival rate was enough to guarantee the birth, in 2014, of the world\u2019s first genetically modified honeybee queens.</p> <p>I was also shown the transgenic queens. Up close, they looked vigorous, but unremarkable. The researchers affixed a magenta-coloured ID tag to the queen\u2019s back, between the base of her wings. She mingled with ordinary worker bees in a small wooden nucleus hive. The sides were made of a hard plastic for viewing. Beye\u2019s research team told me their transgenic bees behave no differently than any other <em>Apis mellifera</em> honeybees. The queen and the workers covered every inch of their cramped confines, popping in and out of a small well containing water. After a week or so, the queen would be moved outside to a flight cage.</p> <p>Beye\u2019s researchers believe manipulating the genome of the European honeybee will lead to new insights into what makes this species unique \u2013 which genes make them such meticulous groomers, or which genes programme the worker bees\u2019 super-assiduous attention to looking after their young. They want to know why bees are so good to each other. Is this instinct to work tirelessly for the good of the hive something learned, or genetic?</p> <p>Beekeepers, dismayed at the prospect of GM bees becoming a reality, made a huge fuss about Beye\u2019s work. Many suspected his lab was bankrolled by the agriculture industry, or \u201cBig Ag\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe beekeeper associations \u2026 \u201d Beye said, shaking his head in lingering disbelief. In person, he is affable and professorial. \u201cThey thought we were working with Bayer. I mean, they\u2019re very close by: Bayer\u2019s headquarters is maybe 20km from here.\u201d He insisted inferences of a Bayer connection were totally false.</p> <p>Beye and Marianne Otte, his research partner, explained that the purpose of their work was to understand the genetic basis for bee behaviour and health. It was never to build a pesticide-resistant bee. Building a GM bee, Beye said, is \u201ca stupid idea\u201d. The world doesn\u2019t need chemical-resistant bees, he says. It needs farming practices that don\u2019t harm bees. \u201cThey should be working on that. Not on manipulating the bee.\u201d</p> <p>But the truth is that Beye\u2019s highly detailed paper serves as a kind of blueprint for how to build a bee. Thanks to research like his, and the emergence of tools such as Crispr, it has never been cheaper or so straightforward for a chemical company to pursue a superbee resistant to, say, the chemicals it makes. Takeo Kubo, a professor of molecular biology at the University of Tokyo, was the second scientist in the world to make a genetically modified bee in his lab. He told me that he, too, is focused on basic research, and has no ties to the agriculture industry. But, unlike Beye, he welcomes the prospect of GM bee swarms buzzing around the countryside. Lab-made, pesticide-resistant bees could be a real saviour for beekeepers and farmers, he says. And, he adds, the science is no more than three years away. \u201cI\u2019m now 57 years old,\u201d he told me via email, \u201cand completely optimistic to see such transgenic bees in the marketplace in my lifetime!\u201d</p> <p>It is not yet legal to release genetically engineered bees into the wild, but the private sector is already watching closely. One US startup contacted Beye\u2019s lab offering to help commercialise their breakthrough research. Beye said no.</p> <p>Beekeepers tend to see the world through the eyes of their bees. After a few hours in their presence, you too begin to re-evaluate your surroundings. The monochrome sameness of our farmlands \u2013 that vast, neat checkerboard of green and brown that feeds us mammals so well \u2013 can be a desert for foraging pollinators. The shocking yellow brilliance of rapeseed in blossom each spring can be a reservoir of pesticides. Beekeepers have learned to mitigate the risks and adapt, mainly by moving their hives around an ever-dwindling patch of safe zones. But the genetically modified bee, which can breed with other species and looks just like bees hand-raised from carefully chosen strains, is an altogether more dangerous challenge.</p> <p>Jay Evans at the US agriculture department, an entomologist and beekeeper, admires Beye\u2019s work, but thinks his breakthrough GM bee should remain confined to the lab. \u201cThe road to making a superbee looks really long to me, and probably not necessary,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see the justification.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Haefeker, a former tech entrepreneur, came to beekeeping late in life, around his 40th birthday. After spending two decades in Silicon Valley, he, his wife and two sons returned home to Germany in 2001, settling in a picturesque village on Lake Starnberg, halfway between Munich and the Bavarian Alps. What started as a backyard hobby quickly became an obsession, then a growing business. Haefeker studied everything about beekeeping, from hive maintenance to nutrition. Later, he developed an iPhone app for breeders called iQueen and started a <a href=\"http://podcasts.haefeker.org/\" title=\"\">podcast called </a><em><a href=\"http://podcasts.haefeker.org/\" title=\"\">Bienenpolitik</a></em>, or Beekeeping and Politics. One of the few tech-savvy beekeepers in bucolic Upper Bavaria, in 2003 Haefeker was recruited to join the local professional beekeepers association where second- and third-generation beekeepers routinely grumbled about modern farming practices gobbling up open space. His first assignment was to investigate an issue that nobody at the organisation knew much about: GM crops. \u201cI had no opinion of GMOs (genetically modified organisms),\u201d he recalls. \u201cBut as the new kid on the block it was my job to figure out: is this going to have an impact on us?\u201d</p> <p>Haefeker\u2019s investigations into GMOs turned into a decade-long crusade. What began as a local case involving a Bavarian beekeeper with GMO-contaminated honey grew into an epic battle, pitting Europe\u2019s beekeepers against two giants: Monsanto, the biotech giant that markets MON810, the pest-resistant genetically modified maize, and the World Trade Organization, which, at the time, was pressuring the EU to give GM crops a chance. The beekeepers eventually <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/sep/07/europe-honey-gm\" title=\"\">won a huge victory in 2011</a> in the European court of justice, keeping European honey, for now, virtually GMO-free. The fight continues, but the beekeepers\u2019 message was clear: don\u2019t underestimate us.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8013dd3d4d810e14af0fa1063213b487ff4b9527\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8013dd3d4d810e14af0fa1063213b487ff4b9527/0_238_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A beekeeper in California with his hives.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A beekeeper in California with his hives.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brett Murphy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The agrichemical companies\u2019 business model is to dominate both ends of the market. They sell the farmer the chemical that kills the pests, and then they sell them their patented seeds, genetically engineered to withstand those very chemicals. (Monsanto\u2019s top-selling line of Roundup Ready herbicide-resistant seeds are marketed as the best defence against Roundup, Monsanto\u2019s top-selling herbicide.) The multinationals have locked farmers into contracts that prevent them from manipulating the seeds to develop their own cross-breed.</p> <p>Beekeepers fear genetic engineering of honeybees will introduce patents and privatisation to one of the last bastions of agriculture that is collectively managed and owned by no one. \u201cThink about it,\u201d Haefeker told me, \u201cthe one area Big Ag doesn\u2019t yet control is pollination.\u201d And pollination is huge. The UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/384726/icode/\" title=\"\">estimates that pollinators</a> help farmers grow crops worth up to $577bn (\u00a3437bn) annually.</p> <p>Damage to the bee population, by harming a vital pollinator, is already threatening crops worldwide. Outside FAO\u2019s headquarters in Rome, a neon billboard flashes in English, Italian and Arabic a series of urgent save-the-planet messages. Save the bees tops the list. If bees disappear, food crops and animal feeds, not to mention the raw materials for biofuels (from canola and palm oil), textiles (cotton) and medicines, will simply vanish from much of the planet. It has got so bad <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/humans-bees-china_us_570404b3e4b083f5c6092ba9\" title=\"\">in some parts of China</a> that humans already pollinate some crops by hand. In what feels like a riff on a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAJfyDTTHE4\" title=\"\">Black Mirror</a> episode, Harvard researchers are working on the <a href=\"https://wyss.harvard.edu/technology/autonomous-flying-microrobots-robobees/\" title=\"\">RoboBee</a>, a flying robotic pollinator that is half the size of a paperclip and weighs less than one-tenth of a gram. In March, Walmart <a href=\"http://images2.freshpatents.com/pdf/US20180065749A1.pdf\" title=\"\">filed a series of patents</a> for its own tiny robotic pollinators.</p> <p>Beekeepers and conservationists believe bees should be left to evolve on their own, helped only by protection of open spaces and best-practice natural breeding methods. Conventional bee breeding has embraced technology in recent years via the introduction of apps, tracking software and temperature-controlled \u201cfinishing\u201d incubators. But the method is otherwise little changed from ancient times. During the year, beekeepers will perform what they call \u201csplitting the hive\u201d, or separating a portion of the colony, frame by frame, and putting the frames in new hives with new inhabitants. This can invigorate the gene pool by introducing hardy newcomers.</p> <p>\u201cBefore the introduction of neonicotinoids,\u201d Haefeker said, \u201cabout 15 years ago, you\u2019d open up the hive and it was bursting with healthy bees. That level of reproductive energy is really crucial.\u201d</p> <p>During 2008, Germany\u2019s infamous season of heavy colony losses, the dead piled up on the ground under Haefeker\u2019s hives and along the hive\u2019s inner floor. \u201cIt\u2019s got better in recent years, since the bans went into place. But we\u2019re not yet back to where we were in the days before neonics,\u201d he said. \u201cThat will take years.\u201d He tests the spring pollen for traces of neonics and other chemicals. The level of contamination is much improved, he says. On his property in Bavaria, he offered me a pinch of raw pollen. The sharp, sweet taste lingered on my tongue. I peered down to get a good look at the workers entering one of the hives. They streamed in one by one, their thighs weighed down with yellow balls of dandelion pollen. \u201cIt\u2019s good, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Haefeker chuckled proudly.</p> <p>By late July, cracks had appeared in the new neonics law. More than a dozen EU member states <a href=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/agriculture-food/news/environmentalists-clash-with-efsa-over-neonicotinoids-ban-exceptions/\" title=\"\">sought loopholes</a> to stay the ban, and <a href=\"https://www.farminguk.com/News/-Far-reaching-consequences-Bayer-to-appeal-against-EU-verdict-neonics_49904.html\" title=\"\">Bayer pledged to appeal</a> against its legal basis, warning that the ban would limit our ability to grow the quantities of \u201csafe, affordable\u201d food we need.</p> <p>Despite the setback, Haefeker remains defiant. \u201cTheir business model is obsolete,\u201d he told me on the phone in July. The \u201cbig six\u201d companies of Big Ag are in the process of merging into three, forming Bayer-Monsanto, Dow-DuPont and Syngenta-ChemChina. This historic, quarter-of-a-trillion-dollar spending spree is a sign of market uncertainty, Haefeker asserts, not strength. The future, he says, is big data. Sensor- and computer-assisted crop care \u2013 digital crop protection, as it is known, in which tiny robots and drones will tend to rows and rows of crops round the clock, picking off pests and releasing super-precise flows of irrigation \u2013 will feed the planet\u2019s billions, not chemicals. \u201cI\u2019ve been telling them this for years.\u201d</p> <p>However ground down by Haefeker\u2019s tireless advocacy for bees they may be, Bayer officials told me they largely concur with his view that the industry is beginning to grow less reliant on chemicals, and investing more in big data and tiny robots. They even let Haefeker in the building from time to time to discuss that digital future.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Humans have been consuming honey since our hunter-gatherer days. Not long after we began farming, we started keeping bees (sugar came several millennia later). About 10,000 years ago <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/268228a0\" title=\"\">artists depicted apiculture</a> on the walls of Spanish caves, and, centuries after that, demand for bees wax and honey drove commerce across the empires of ancient Greece and Rome. In the 20th century, apiology, the study of bees, took off. In the 1920s, Austrian zoologist Karl von Frisch was the first to explain the meaning of the honeybees\u2019 waggle dance, which communicates to other bees the direction and distance of a food source; a half-century later he won the Nobel Prize. Honeybees are eusocial creatures, making them one of the most studied insects on the planet. Researchers study the species to understand <a href=\"https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/news/nr/sheffield-university-study-honeybees-human-brain-1.771298\" title=\"\">how the human brain</a> works and to improve the design of supercomputers. Bees, it turns out, <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2018-06-scientists-bees-concept.html\" title=\"\">can even do abstract maths.</a>There are 22 million beekeepers across 146 countries, estimates Apimondia, a 123-year-old organisation that protects and promotes the livelihood of beekeepers, and lately they have been seeing a dramatic rise in membership. \u201cDuring a downturn in the economy of a country, the number of new members increases,\u201d Philip McCabe, an Irish beekeeper and president of Apimondia, told me. The media attention around colony collapse and bee health continues to bring in new members as well.</p> <p>In October, 2017, Haefeker delivered a presentation at Apimondia\u2019s International Apicultural Congress in Istanbul, unveiling Apimondia\u2019s answer to Frankenbees. Like Haefeker himself, the fix he proposes is geeky and left-leaning: an <a href=\"http://opensourcebees.org/?page_id=27&amp;lang=en\" title=\"\">open-source license for honeybees</a>. A software engineer, he takes inspiration from the free software movement of the 1980s and 90s, which gave birth to the \u201copen source\u201d concept. Now, he sees such a licence promoting open collaboration as the perfect model to protect the beekeepers from a nightmare scenario \u2013 powerful corporations building a genetically engineered bee that they then commercialise and lock down with patents and trademarks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"eba0ee26f555d675b1da3033cc7f4d52254b5969\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eba0ee26f555d675b1da3033cc7f4d52254b5969/0_150_2048_1228/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A bee covered in pollen from a sunflower.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A bee covered in pollen from a sunflower.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In his opening remarks, Haefeker launched into what he called \u201cthe big question\u201d. \u201cDid anybody ask our permission before they took our bees, the bees we have been working on, selecting and breeding within Apimondia, before the scientists decided to take these bees and modify them?\u201d The answer was, of course, no. Until that moment, nobody, not even beekeepers, claimed an ownership stake on the bees\u2019 genetic code. Anyone can start a hive, which might explain why you can find beekeepers tending to hives in <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-honey/beekeeping-in-yemen-becomes-a-dangerous-profession-in-war-idUSKBN1KS1N2\" title=\"\">Yemeni war zones</a>, on the roof of <a href=\"https://www.operadeparis.fr/en/news/bees-at-the-opera-bastille\" title=\"\">Paris\u2019 Bastille opera house</a> and in <a href=\"https://www.oxfam.org.au/2017/03/a-hive-of-activity-in-tanzanias-refugee-camps/\" title=\"\">Tanzanian refugee camps</a>. The free exchange of breeding materials \u2013 from the queens and her eggs to the drones\u2019 sperm \u2013 has long been encouraged to keep colonies genetically diverse. Through this free exchange, we preserve a common resource, benefitting everyone and everything. The beekeepers get healthier colonies out of the arrangement. We get flowers, food and honey.</p> <p>To get around any attempt by the agriculture industry to distribute and license superbees, Apimondia is seeking to enshrine this freedom as a right in the form of an open-source contract, establishing bee breeding as a public good that nobody can own outright.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the most efficient way to legally protect our bees from patenting and privatisation by commercial interests,\u201d Haefeker insists. Later, he told me, \u201cwe don\u2019t want to get screwed, the way farmers did by corporations and their GM patented seeds.\u201d</p> <p>Apimondia has minuscule lobbying resources, but it has lined up powerful allies, including the FAO, environmental NGOs and scientific advisers. Together, they press for international treaties to protect vital pollinators. Now Apimondia, too, is sounding the alarm on GM honeybees. Radical bee-breeding experiments don\u2019t always end well, McCabe reminded me. Beekeepers won\u2019t soon forget the story of the Africanised bee, a cross-breed between the African bee and European strains introduced in South America in the 1950s. It escaped quarantine, mated with indigenous species and then multiplied and multiplied, venturing thousands of miles north into the US, breeding with local species and quickly coming to dominate their gene pool. It landed the unfortunate, even nativist, nickname \u201cAfrican killer bee\u201d for the aggressive manner in which it defends its nest. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re concerned with,\u201d McCabe says, \u201cany inter-breeding that messes with the genetics of indigenous bee populations.\u201d</p> <p>Jay Evans keeps bees on the grounds of his job at the USDA, at the government research facility in Maryland, 30 minutes north of Washington DC. I contacted him by phone and asked how things were going.</p> <p>\u201cTerribly,\u201d he said with a wry laugh. \u201cThe losses have doubled in the last 10 years.\u201d He blames a host of factors, with disease and parasites such as the varroa mite chief among them. Beekeepers, he added, are closely watching what happens next in Europe. \u201cI go to beekeepers\u2019 meetings all the time. They\u2019re suffering. They\u2019re trying to keep their operations afloat. They\u2019re desperate for a new solution, or technology, or regulation. Anything,\u201d he says. But there\u2019s consensus on what they don\u2019t want. \u201cWhen I talk to a group, I talk a lot about genetics. And occasionally they\u2019ll say: \u2018Are you making a transgenic bee, one of those Frankenbees?\u2019\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Haefeker and his business partner, Arno Bruder, run their beekeeping enterprise on a field bordering two organic farms in Upper Bavaria. Their colonies have recovered somewhat since the neonics ban went into effect, he said, but they take steps to protect their hives. A lot of beekeepers pack their hives on to trailers and position them near nature reserves or in fields like the one in which we stood. \u201cOver time you learn where you have the worst exposure to whatever it is that harms the bees,\u201d Haefeker said.</p> <p>He pulled out a frame to reveal a queen. Like an awkward commuter on the tube, she brushed up against every inhabitant near her as she made her way from one end of the frame to the other. The jostling has a purpose; it reassures the cavorting masses. \u201cIt\u2019s the queen\u2019s pheromones,\u201d he explained. It makes them relaxed and productive. \u201cThe pheromones affect us beekeepers, too.\u201d He says he plans to harness this anti-stress essence and build a kind of a bee-powered wellness centre on the two-hectare property. I pictured Munich\u2019s pampered classes soaking up queen-bee pheromones in a lodge in the hills around Lake Starnberg. A moment later, Haefeker put the frame back, closed the lid, and surveyed his hives with satisfaction. He and Bruder then discussed what\u2019s next.</p> <p>Keeping bees safe from pesticides is labour-intensive and requires specialist local knowledge. Bruder agreed to wake before dawn the following morning and pack up some of the hives, load them on to a trailer and drive the bees to higher ground. They had decided on a region in the foothills of the Alps, about an hour away, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wieskirche\" title=\"\">near the Wieskirche</a>, an 18th-century church on the Unesco world heritage list. There would be fresh dandelion flowers up there. The bees would be further away from intensive agriculture, said Haefeker. \u201cWe\u2019ve scouted out the locations.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/14/a-different-dimension-of-loss-great-insect-die-off-sixth-extinction\">\u2018A different dimension of loss\u2019: inside the great insect die-off</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Meanwhile, it is possible that humankind has even more extreme designs on bees.

It proposes using insects to carry immune-boosting mutations designed to protect crops from drought, flooding, pathogens and bioweapons. In essence, the visiting insects would modify the plant\u2019s genetic makeup. A group of academics from universities in Germany and France declared the programme\u2019s existence alarming, <a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/10/crop-protecting-insects-could-be-turned-bioweapons-critics-warn\" title=\"\">saying it turns the insects</a> themselves into bioweapons.</p> <p>Darpa does not say what kind of insects it plans to use, but Haefeker did not like the sound of it. \u201cWe need to keep an eye on this craziness,\u201d his text read, \u201cin case they want to use bees to transport their genetically modified viruses into crops.\u201d </p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, or sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 This main image in this article was changed on 16 October 2018 to replace a photograph of a hoverfly.</p>", "wordcount": "4793"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "lifeandstyle/2018/oct/13/garden-tips-plant-sedums-sow-sweet-pea-seeds-this-week", "type": "article", "sectionId": "lifeandstyle", "sectionName": "Life and style", "webPublicationDate": "2018-10-13T10:00:30Z", "webTitle": "Gardening tips: plant sedums", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/oct/13/garden-tips-plant-sedums-sow-sweet-pea-seeds-this-week", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/oct/13/garden-tips-plant-sedums-sow-sweet-pea-seeds-this-week", "fields": {"byline": "Jane Perrone", "body": "<p><strong>Plant this</strong> Sedums are brilliant plants for sunny spots in the garden, flowering from late summer right through to first frosts: great for the bees, and drought tolerant, too.

This couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. You can squeeze a lot into a small plot: be bold, be strong, ensure a lavish backbone of evergreens with spring colour to enliven spirits after the long winter gloom \u2013 and don\u2019t forget to incorporate scent. But remember, in small gardens, less is often more: it\u2019s better to do one thing well rather than a lot in a muddled fashion.</p> <p>Large gardens have an element of safety, deploying swathes of green lawn which is economical to install and covers large areas of ground. A small garden has to work much harder and, per sq metre, can cost more. But it\u2019s worth it: with thought and care, your little patch can be a true extension of your home and provide a haven for you, as well as the wildlife we share our urban spaces with.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b6db22659ffa1d5397a8a5c1d7e348ed498f765b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6db22659ffa1d5397a8a5c1d7e348ed498f765b/0_0_3700_5550/667.jpg\" alt=\"Colour provides a striking backdrop for a bed of herbs.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Colour provides a striking backdrop for a bed of herbs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Helen Fickling</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Before you start, measure your space and draw it to scale. This may sound \u2018designery\u2019, but will help you to figure out the plants and materials you need, what furniture will and will not work and, more importantly, what will fit through the access you have, if you don\u2019t want to run the expense of a crane or lifting equipment.</p> <p>Next, think about how you want to use the garden: dining, lounging, outdoor cooking, entertaining, children\u2019s play? And how much gardening you want to do when it\u2019s finished: are you retired and able to spare the time, or do you work a full week? These factors will help you decide whether it\u2019s worth installing the shiny, mirrored surfaces you love considering the effort it will take to keep them clean, or whether that hard-to-grow plant is worth the effort it demands. </p> <p>As with all gardens, planting appropriately for your site is vital. Small gardens can be sun traps, with their own microclimates, or shaded. If you have the former, and feel adventurous, you could consider tropical species. Leafy, architectural plants look amazing when lit up at night and, since they are generally green all year, will make your garden look wonderful for longer.</p> <p>A few of my favourite go-to plants for urban gardens are big and leafy (see below); These plants, as well as scented and glossy-leaved varieties, add drama. Scent is wonderful on a bright winter\u2019s day or long summer night, and glossy leaves help to bounce light around making even a simple palette of green look bright and lively.</p> <p>Plants only thrive when planted in ground that is well prepared. Soil preparation may seem rather dull compared to purchasing a bench or barbecue, but it is by far the most important aspect of any garden, regardless of its size. Pay attention to your soil, choose the right plants for the right place, irrigate if you can (you have already expended time, energy and money on your plants so make sure they are watered) and you will reap the benefits.</p> <p>Attract wildlife with feeders. Alternatively, select plants that provide fruits or berries. If you can garden organically then all the better: let birds take care of the aphids, or plant a small thyme or camomile lawn \u2013 bees and insects will thank you. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"016ff0e525f17b2954a6479f3477ca98e742057a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/016ff0e525f17b2954a6479f3477ca98e742057a/0_0_3929_2744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tree with leaves turning red.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"698\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Deciduous trees map the seasons as their leaves change colour.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Helen Fickling</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Are there any absolute nos to designing a small garden? Not really: what works for one person might not work for another, so tailor your space to your requirements.

In the end, politics among the survivors of plague, war and famine was reduced to a bitter fratricidal struggle over a defensible potato patch. Like most of the so-called \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jul/05/jane-rogers-top-10-cosy-catastrophes\" title=\"\">cosy catastrophe</a>\u201d novels, this could be criticised for optimism. Grim though a future of famine and the war of all against all might seem, the consequences were largely confined to humans.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/10/plummeting-insect-numbers-threaten-collapse-of-nature\" title=\"\">threatened extinction of insect populations</a> around the world raises the prospect of a much more general catastrophe, which would implicate plants, birds, fish, small mammals, and everything else that depends on insects. That\u2019s just the start. Other species, and we ourselves, depend on the animals and plants that need insects. When they go, we go. This is not just a greater catastrophe. It\u2019s a much more plausible one. The most recent study concluded that insect biomass is decreasing around the world at a rate of 2.5% a year. At that rate, half the insects in the world will be gone in 50 years\u2019 time, and all of them in a century \u2013 although no one will be keeping track of centuries then.</p> <p>The chief driver of this catastrophe is unchecked human greed. For all our individual and even collective cleverness, we behave as a species with as little foresight as a colony of nematode worms that will consume everything it can reach until all is gone and it dies off naturally. The challenge of behaving more intelligently than creatures that have no brain at all will not be easy. But unlike the nematodes, we know what to do. The UN convention on biodiversity was signed in 1992, alongside the convention on climate change. Giving it the strength to curb our appetites is now urgent. Biodiversity is not an optional extra. It is the web that holds all life, including human life.</p> <p>The two main expressions of greed that hasten this apocalypse are global warming and industrial agriculture. It appears that most of the damage is being done in the developed world by farming practices. The use of giant fields, devoid of shelter for insects of any sort at all, whether they are harmful to human interests or not, and where the plants are drenched in long-lasting pesticides, has been fatal for uncounted billions of insects. The effects of this kind of farming reach beyond the fields immediately affected, too. There has been a huge loss of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/11/insect-declines-new-alarm-over-mayfly-is-tip-of-iceberg-warn-experts\" title=\"\">aquatic insect species</a> from the rivers into which the products of industrial agriculture are flushed by rain. Even in German nature reserves, which are by definition protected from the use of pesticides, there have been steep falls in insect populations because so many of the most widely used ones are persistent and prevent breeding. In the tropics, the steady rise of global temperatures is already devastating whole ecosystems, starting at the bottom with the insects. Last year we learned of the disappearance of almost all the ground-dwelling insects from a rainforest in Puerto Rico, and three-quarters of the species of the canopy. </p> <p>Some governments have done some necessary things. The EU has banned neonicotinoid pesticides. But the necessary change also relies on individual action. As individuals we must consume less in every way, which helps with climate change. We must also change our food habits. To eat less meat and more organic is not just piety. A little self-restraint in this generation will make all the difference to our grandchildren.</p>", "wordcount": "612"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}, {"id": "commentisfree/2019/feb/22/biodiversity-human-life-un-report-shrinking-species-bumblebees-humanity", "type": "article", "sectionId": "commentisfree", "sectionName": "Opinion", "webPublicationDate": "2019-02-22T12:05:13Z", "webTitle": "We\u2019ve had an apocalyptic warning: now will we care about biodiversity? | Martha Gill", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/22/biodiversity-human-life-un-report-shrinking-species-bumblebees-humanity", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/22/biodiversity-human-life-un-report-shrinking-species-bumblebees-humanity", "fields": {"byline": "Martha Gill", "body": "<p>For a global hazard to really get respect these days, it has to threaten Armageddon. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/15/young-climate-change-greta-thunberg-children\" title=\"\">Climate change</a>, for instance, is the stuff of apocalyptic movies: it is about flooding, fire and famine.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/feb/21/worlds-food-supply-under-severe-threat-from-loss-of-biodiversity\">World's food supply under 'severe threat' from loss of biodiversity</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/feb/21/worlds-food-supply-under-severe-threat-from-loss-of-biodiversity\" title=\"\">loss of biodiversity</a>, on the other hand \u2013 the shrinking spread of species on the planet \u2013 ranks further down the scale.

But how best to turn the average British garden into an idyll for birds, mammals and, yes, even bugs? Wildlife gardening expert <a href=\"https://www.wildlife-gardening.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Jenny Steel</a> weighs in.</p> <h2>Reject pesticides \u2013 and get your wildlife working for you</h2> <p>\u201cGardening organically is incredibly important,\u201d says Steel. \u201cIf you\u2019re using pesticides and sprays, you\u2019re basically removing a big food source, especially for birds, as they feed on small invertebrates.\u201d If you are worried about slugs, a beer trap is a good alternative \u2013 simply pour some beer into a little container on the ground, and the slugs will go into it. But Steel prefers to get nature working for her. \u201cSay you\u2019ve got lots of aphids eating your roses: you can encourage blue tits to come and eat those aphids by hanging a bird feeder next to the roses. That way, your garden wildlife is working for you \u2013 because everything eats something else.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Make a pond, if you can</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ad003c5b0d7818f9cbaaef73649c5c5ff6b98554\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad003c5b0d7818f9cbaaef73649c5c5ff6b98554/0_2106_3024_1814/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A garden pond\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018 A pond is somewhere not only birds and mammals will come to drink, but you\u2019ll also get dragonflies, and frogs will spawn there.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: mtreasure/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cBirds need to drink and keep their feathers clean,\u201d she explains, \u201cso if you have room for a small wetland area, like a little pond, that\u2019s a fantastic habitat. It\u2019s somewhere not only birds and mammals will come to drink, but you\u2019ll also get dragonflies, and frogs will spawn there.\u201d If there isn\u2019t room for a pond, or you have young children, a birdbath is a good idea.</p> <h2><strong>Creepy-crawlies are your friends</strong></h2> <p>Even if you don\u2019t like them, insects are crucial to maintaining a healthy garden ecosystem. Steel thinks that bug hotels are a waste of time and money. \u201cFind some space in your garden underneath a shrub or bush and pile up some moist twigs, bark or small logs. That\u2019s a great place for beetles and other invertebrates to have their homes.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Don\u2019t just let your lawn grow wild</strong></h2> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve read a lot recently about how brilliant it is to let your lawn grow and how it makes this fantastic wildlife habitat,\u201d Steel says. \u201cUnfortunately, it doesn\u2019t.\u201d Most suburban lawns planted post-1950 use rye grass, which is durable and hard-wearing, but not great for wildlife. If you want a mini-meadow in your garden, the best thing to do is leave part of the garden unmown and sow other types of grass and suitable wildflowers for the soil. \u201cThe idea of leaving a garden so it goes wild is a myth,\u201d she says. \u201cA garden needs to be managed, because if you don\u2019t manage it, all you end up with is nettles \u2013 and you need a diversity of plants to attract different types of wildlife.\u201d So, get in your garden, and start snipping those nettles and weeds.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/30/how-to-rewild-your-garden-ditch-chemicals-and-decorate-the-concrete\">How to rewild your garden: ditch chemicals and decorate the concrete</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Plant things for wildlife to eat</strong></h2> <p>What you grow in your garden is critically important, Steel says. She advises planting wild marjoram: it\u2019s great for insects, and you can eat it. \u201cEveryone should also have a buddleia of some sort,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re great for butterflies, and also give lots of pollen and nectar for bees and moths.\u201d It\u2019s worth remembering, however, that some species of buddleia are highly <a href=\"https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/advice/gardening-for-wildlife/plants-for-wildlife/shrubs-for-gardens/invasive-shrubs/\" title=\"\">invasive</a>.</p> <h2>Educate yourself</h2> <p>The best way to create an eco-friendly garden is to educate yourself. \u201cGet a good book on wildlife \u2013 there are lots now,\u201d Steels says. (She has published several herself.) Don\u2019t just assume something is good or bad.\u201d And enjoy the process of learning. \u201cThe more you find out about the wildlife that uses your garden, the more fascinated you\u2019ll become.

What is more likely is that some years ago an original pioneer took root and then sent out rhizomes to creep inch-wise across our lawn bank. In fact, I recall registering a violet or two last year and took pictures to celebrate the \u201carrival\u201d. </p> <p>This spring the colony has expanded its territory to the extent that there are now 146 flowers in total.

Adding dried apple will make sage more palatable. Equally as good cooled and drunk as a flavoured water.</p> <p>Elderflower and elderberries have strong antiviral properties. Elderflower is lovely steeped in water for four or more hours, perhaps with a few slices of orange and lemon. Elderberries need to be brewed in a rolling boil with plenty of honey added. The leaves and stems of elder will give you an upset stomach, so remove flowers and berries with the back of a fork first.</p> <p>Nettles have good antihistamine properties, so are great for hayfever sufferers. Use either fresh or dried leaves to make an infusion. I prefer the taste of fresh nettles; mix dried nettles with elderflower or lemon verbena to improve the flavour. The plant needs to be harvested before it flowers, for potency.</p> <p>Hyssop is a lovely old-fashioned herb that brings the bees to the garden.

It raises visitors\u2019 awareness of environmental issues and illustrates the 4,000-year history of beekeeping and honey-making, from the ancient Egyptians via the Romans. A Hive Aid scheme lets you adopt a beehive at one of three locations nearby, and regular courses (from \u00a360pp) train new generations of beekeepers.</p> <h2>Fun fact</h2> <p>Bees pollinate about a third of everything we eat and play a vital role in sustaining our ecosystems.

The reliance on a small number of species means they are more susceptible to disease outbreaks and climate change. It renders food production less resilient,\u201d warned Julie B\u00e9langer, the coordinator of the report.</p> \n<p>As examples, the report noted how overdependence on a narrow range of species was a major factor in the famine caused by potato blight in Ireland in the 1840s, cereal crop failures in the US in the 20th century, and losses of taro production in Samoa in the 1990s.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere is an urgent need to change the way food is produced and ensure that biodiversity is not something that is swept aside but is treated as an irreplaceable resource and a key part of management strategies,\u201d said B\u00e9langer.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"39762535-d06b-4ebe-ab70-5086c57547bd\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\"></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The report found evidence that attitudes and practices were slowly changing. In recent years, there has been a greater uptake in sustainable forest management, ecosystem approaches to fisheries, aquaponics and polyculture. But the authors said there had been insufficient progress. Organic agriculture, for example, now covers 58m hectares (143m acres) worldwide, but this is only 1% of global farmland.</p> \n<p>The report signalled a heightened interest by governments in biodiversity, a subject that rarely gets the same attention as climate change. Many states reported economic losses caused by disappearing or shifting ecosystems. Ireland, Norway, Poland and Switzerland noted shrinking bumblebee populations. Egypt was concerned that its fishing industry would suffer because fish were migrating northwards due to rising ocean temperatures. Gambia said communities were being forced to buy expensive industrially-produced products because free wild food sources were becoming scarcer.</p> \n<p>The biodiversity crisis is set to rise up the global agenda, with discussion on the topic at the next G7 in April, <a href=\"https://www.iucn.org/about/world-conservation-congress\">a World Conservation Congress in June</a>, and then a major UN conference in Beijing next year.</p> \n<p>\u201cAround the world, the library of life that has evolved over billions of years \u2013 our biodiversity \u2013 is being destroyed, poisoned, polluted, invaded, fragmented, plundered, drained and burned at a rate not seen in human history,\u201d <a href=\"https://greennews.ie/president-higgins-timeframe-halt-extinction-crisis-perilously-short/\">Ireland\u2019s president, Michael Higgins, said</a> at a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/biodcon_ie?lang=en\">biodiversity conference in Dublin</a> on Thursday. \u201cIf we were coal miners we\u2019d be up to our waists in dead canaries.\u201d</p>", "wordcount": "885"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "lifeandstyle/2019/may/22/chelsea-flower-show-2019-top-garden-trends", "type": "article", "sectionId": "lifeandstyle", "sectionName": "Life and style", "webPublicationDate": "2019-05-22T09:59:08Z", "webTitle": "Chelsea flower show 2019: this year's top garden trends", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/may/22/chelsea-flower-show-2019-top-garden-trends", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2019/may/22/chelsea-flower-show-2019-top-garden-trends", "fields": {"byline": "Jane Perrone", "body": "<h2>1 Go green</h2> <p>Green was the dominant theme at Chelsea, literally and metaphorically.

I briefly thought about burning my house down to get rid of the thing, but eventually settled with thrashing it with a soap dispenser and screaming until I thought it was dead.

I, too, love to be among trees, and want to leave young ones behind when I die. This is why I planted them, and continue to plant them.</p> <p>We have inherited mature and wonderful trees in our cities, towns, villages, gardens, cemeteries, woods and countryside. They were planted, or self-sown, years, even centuries ago. We take them for granted, ignore the creatures living among them, remain in ignorance of the good trees are doing us (cleaning the air, for instance) and cut them down for new developments. Yet we retain a feeling of affection for the idea of them, which may account for the reaction the government faced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/oct/29/uk-government-forest-sell-off\" title=\"\">in 2010 when it sought to sell off publicly owned woods</a>, and for the wide support the Woodland Trust attracts.</p> <p>Trees need space, which is why I, a city-dweller, bought my Somerset scrubland in 1999.

Tree diseases new to the UK, wind, drought and flood were all stacking up against them.</p> <p>But I did not expect things to move so fast. The woodland is still good, the new trees are growing like mad, but the creatures are in decline. The rabbits have disappeared (rabbit haemorrhagic disease, perhaps?) and the owl has moved. The bees, dragonflies, butterflies and moths are still there but in smaller numbers.

Suddenly, the seasons became much more than dull weather reports on the radio or the cause for delays in my commute. When I became a novice shepherd, the seasons transformed into acute physical sensations; cold, heat, snow, rain and wind that could chill me to the bone. For the sheep, the seasons govern their entire existence \u2013 their life goes from nibbling on winter feed, to the lambing in the spring, to grazing on the vast summer pastures and finally ends with the autumn slaughter.</p> <p>In many ways, my lifestyle change has resulted in a clash between a reflective, philosophical mind and a practical, weather-dependent reality. However, I still like to read books and what I have come to realise is that my reading experience is closely intertwined with my physical reality. Here are 10 books \u2013 fiction and non-fiction \u2013 that are my ode to the seasons.</p> <h2><strong>Summer</strong></h2> <p><strong>1. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/outline-564565.html\">Outline by Rachel Cusk</a><br></strong>The novel shows us exactly how the seasons appear in the context of an urban intellectual life \u2013 they hardly exist at all. However, the most significant change in weather in Outline takes place on a flight to Greece and Cusk evokes the sense of a steamy Greek summer, marked by sticky relationships, an alter ego attempting to cool off and, in the end, the stifling heat from the life stories of the surrounding characters crawling under the protagonist\u2019s skin.</p> <p><strong>2. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/three-men-in-a-boat-13.html\">Three Men in a Boat by Jerome K Jerome</a><br></strong>The humour in this tale of summer boating holiday along the River Thames may be outdated but this could be the reason why it made me laugh so much. Despite the Victorian English upper-class setting, this book still strikes a chord and the nuisances of everyday life are an inexhaustible source of amusement and laughter.</p> <h2><strong>Autumn</strong></h2> <p><strong>3. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/history-of-bees-557755.html\">The History of Bees by Maja Lunde</a><br></strong>This is a debut novel about the honey bee\u2019s crucial significance to humankind\u2019s life on Earth. To me, it is an autumnal book because this is the time when I feed my bees \u2013 we have five hives on the farm. The autumn is when I sense the bees\u2019 desperation, knowing they will have to face the cold and wintry conditions ahead. Lunde poignantly depicts our fragile relationship with the environment in the stories of succeeding generations of beekeepers. Just as bees tirelessly produce their honey milligram by milligram, Lunde builds her story detail by detail into an intricate treat for her readers.</p> <p><strong>4. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/lives-of-animals-439670.html\">The Lives of Animals by JM Coetzee</a><br></strong>In the autumn we slaughter our lambs \u2013 there are blood, intestines, slaughtering guns and knives. Before the move to the farm, I was a vegetarian. It was a decision founded both on logic and on emotion. In his book, Coetzee combines these two seemingly disparate aspects \u2013 logical thinking and emotion. He presents noble and coherent arguments against eating meat, while portraying our complex feelings towards it and the killing of animals.</p> <h2><strong>Winter</strong></h2> <p><strong>5. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/aug/15/proust-remembrance-summer-rain-weatherwatch\">In Search of Lost Time by Marcel Proust</a><br></strong>Sometimes the winter in Sweden is unbearable. The skin on my hands begins to freeze and my face stiffens against the wind. I go inside, put some extra logs on the stove and tuck into Proust. Of course, I no longer have the time to devote days and weeks to this epic work, but now that I have read it once, I am able to open any one of the seven volumes and become totally absorbed within minutes. The text is like an onion with layer on layer of meaning. Despite its underlying cynicism, it always warms me up. It seems to activate so many parts of the brain and emotions; even though I sit still, I find my body filled with a kind of kinetic energy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9cdeab847ecfd10c3513b622143025e954ea9476\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9cdeab847ecfd10c3513b622143025e954ea9476/0_0_5954_3573/1000.jpg\" alt=\"a hiker looking over Glacier Grey in Chile.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Blue is the colour of longing for the distance you never arrive in\u2019 \u2026 a hiker looking over Glacier Grey in Chile.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>6. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/field-guide-to-getting-lost-498189.html\">A Field Guide to Getting Lost by Rebecca Solnit</a><br></strong>A book about social criticism, thinking outside the box and political resistance, but also about wandering in nature without a map. Four of Solnit\u2019s essays share a common title, The Blue of Distance, which alludes to how the nuances of blue colour in the snow can help hikers determine distance and orientate themselves. A true ode to the winter: \u201cBlue is the colour of longing for the distance you never arrive in.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Spring</strong></h2> <p><strong>7. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/12/peter-wohlleben-man-who-believes-trees-talk-to-each-other\">The Hidden Life of Trees by Peter Wohlleben</a><br></strong>Reading Wohlleben is like joining him on one of his excursions to a national park in northern Germany. Yes, it is wordy and a bit sententious, but still so very seductive. I am amazed by the multi-faceted interaction between the trees and other plants and animals. It made me look at the beech trees on my farm with a new, almost religious, sense of awe. The beeches stand strong and dense, forming their own climate zone. In the spring an almost surreal jade-tinged light sifts through the foliage. After reading Wohlleben, I walk there humbly, as if walking into a cathedral.</p> <p><strong><br>8. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/silent-spring-2.html\">Silent Spring by Rachel Carson</a><br></strong>Carson\u2019s book was a breakthrough for modern environmental awareness. Some say that the problems that Carson addresses have become obsolete, (for instance the fact that pesticide DDT is now banned). I think that in the past 50 years, society has become desensitised to the idea that human activity constantly destroys nature. For Carson, any deterioration of the environment poses a problem. She wonders why we should be content withwith animals and plants just barely surviving? </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d6128274cdd6d06c68be8f7fc717d32883de4d0f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6128274cdd6d06c68be8f7fc717d32883de4d0f/0_126_1278_767/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wild Parrots Of Telegraph Hill, San Francisco.

The book portrays the surprising and charming love story between man, animal and nature, especially the relationship between the wild and the tame. In one of the finest scenes, the wild parrots chatter in triumph having survived the cold winter nights and welcome the spring, reminding them of their Amazonian origins.</p> <h2><strong>For all seasons</strong></h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/30/top-10-books-to-help-you-survive-the-digital-age\">Top 10 books to help you survive the digital age</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>10. <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/v36/n24/nicholas-spice/she-shall-be-nameless\">The Wall by Marlen Haushofer</a><br></strong>A woman is inexplicably caught behind a transparent wall in the Alps. On the other side of the wall a strange catastrophe has taken place and everything seems to have died. Her only companions are a dog, some cats and a cow. In many ways, the novel is a fascinating manual for living off the grid. There is the hay harvest, the milking, the hilling of potatoes, the wood-chopping and the hunting \u2013 a dream for someone like me. At the same time, this is a tale of utter futility where there is no one to talk to.

That\u2019s also a good explanation for the current crop of bee books: not just <em>A Honeybee Heart</em> and Thor Hanson\u2019s <em>Buzz</em>, but Kate Bradbury\u2019s wonderful <em>The Bumblebee Flies Anyway</em> and Maja Lunde\u2019s <em>The History of Bees</em>, among others. Books, like hives, are ways of capturing something and holding on to it: either helping to preserve it, or looking at it closely before it\u2019s gone.</p> <p><em>A Honeybee Heart</em> is in the tradition of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jul/23/h-is-for-hawk-helen-macdonald-review\">H Is for Hawk</a></em> and other recent works that combine natural history with memoir. Some have felt rather stale and derivative, or have overplayed the author\u2019s emotional link with the creature in question. Happily, Jukes avoids this: she\u2019s interested in bees because, well, bees are interesting, and if anything the personal side is played down, particularly at the start of the book.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/01/terrified-flying-insects-twerking-bee-cure-meghan-duchess-sussex\">I\u2019m terrified of flying insects \u2013 could a twerking bee cure me?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Having had some experience helping a beekeeper in London, she decides to get a hive not long after moving to Oxford. Bored in her job, restless and lacking stable attachments, Jukes discovers that keeping bees helps to anchor her, and she explores the way in which they change her, just as her efforts alter the behaviour of the bees. There\u2019s some satisfying (if at times slightly pat) mirroring as the personal and apine sides of the book progress in tandem, but she wears her considerable research lightly. I only wish I could have envisaged her hive better: it\u2019s a \u201ctop bar\u201d type rather than the more familiar Langstroth, and her descriptions of what the bees were building each time she opened it seemed fascinating, but went clean over my head. It is not unreasonable to ask how many more nature memoirs the market can support; the answer, I think, is only the best. Finely written and insightful, <em tabindex=\"-1\">A Honeybee Heart</em> is surely one of them.</p> <p>Like Jukes, Hanson is aware of his own subjectivity and writes himself (and bee-loving son Noah) into the narrative; gone are the days when natural history writing was dry and high-handed, a style born from a presumption of objectivity when decisions about what is and isn\u2019t studied, and how knowledge is transmitted, are anything but. He is a US conservation biologist, and has previously published books about gorillas, feathers and seeds. His latest, <em tabindex=\"-1\">Buzz</em>, focuses mainly on wild bees rather than <em tabindex=\"-1\">Apis mellifera</em>, describing their evolution, interaction with plants, relationship with humans and the challenges facing them now. It\u2019s popular science at its most accessible: fun, fascinating and full of engaging pen portraits of the scientists and bee enthusiasts he meets in the course of his research.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"38180d0aec72e44f7f7f2960923731bb165539eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38180d0aec72e44f7f7f2960923731bb165539eb/0_64_1920_1152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A bee sits on a flower.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Roughly 40% of all bee species are in decline or threatened with extinction.\u2019 <br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After a rather flat start discussing sphecid wasps, proto-bees and evolution, Hanson travels to Arizona to learn about taxonomy and physiology at something called the Bee Course. A visit to a retired mason bee supplier prompts an explanation of solitary bee behaviour; pollination is examined in relation to Beth Norden, co-discoverer of a key species in the quest to understand how flowers and bees grew to depend on one another. Each chapter is loosely structured around a place, a person and/or a type of bee, providing the opportunity for wider discussion both of bees and of our relationship with them. Only a trip to a McDonald\u2019s to remove everything bee-dependent from a Big Mac feels gimmicky; fortunately, he quickly moves on to a California date plantation where he discovers the arduous nature of hand-pollination (and the reason dates cost so much).</p> <p>Roughly 40% of all bee species are in decline or threatened with extinction, and by the final section of this book Hanson\u2019s sense of wonder has rubbed off on us so that his meeting with an entomologist who recorded the extinction of a bumblebee really hits home. The discussion addresses the complex forces contributing to bee decline and lays bare human involvement. Catastrophic factors include a globalised trade in fruit, vegetables and bees themselves; the consequent spread of natural pests and pathogens; the interaction in bees\u2019 bodies of a range of agrichemicals never tested in combination; intensification of land use with a resulting loss of biodiversity and the creation of crop monocultures.</p> <p>But Hanson leaves us with hope: a visit to an almond orchard that is bringing bees back to a landscape from which they have long been absent \u2013 commercial hives trucked in for three weeks to pollinate, but the groves kept insect-free the rest of the year. Hanson rightly credits the turnaround to relationships built between individuals: growers, researchers, investors, heads of multinational conglomerates and conservationists at NGOs. There is something about bees, it seems, that can really bring people together; let\u2019s hope it isn\u2019t too late.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em><em>A Honeybee Heart Has Five Openings is published by Scribner.

With bright orange casing and a smartphone clipped to her back end, she looks like a cross between an expensive toy and the kind of rover used on space missions. Up close, she has four USB ports, a disc-like GPS receiver, and the nuts and bolts of a system called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/06/lidar-self-driving-technology-tesla-crash-elon-musk\" title=\"\">Lidar</a>, which enables her to orient herself using laser beams. She cost around \u00a32,000 to make.</p> <p>Every three seconds, Rachel takes a closeup photograph of the plants and soil around her, which will build into a forensic map of the field and the wider farm beyond. After 20 minutes or so of this, she is momentarily disturbed by two of the farm\u2019s dogs, unsure what to make of her.</p> <p>Watching her progress from a corner of the field are three people from the <a href=\"https://www.smallrobotcompany.com/\" title=\"\">Small Robot Company</a>, and the farmer who co-owns the land. Jamie Butler grows wheat \u2013 an uncertain business that can easily tip into the red. The weather is a constant source of anxiety; a hot summer like this year\u2019s is exactly the kind of unforeseen event that can disrupt even the most careful forecasts. \u201cIf wheat was all we did,\u201d he says, \u201cthere\u2019s no way we\u2019d be able to support our families.\u201d He also keeps cows, and uses some of his land for fly fishing, \u201cglamping\u201d holidays, corporate awaydays and self-storage. He worries about Brexit causing a big drop in the subsidies he currently gets from Brussels.</p> <p>What does he make of Rachel? \u201cThis is the revolution,\u201d he says. And he could well be right: if the robot working in this field is the shape of farming to come, it could have dramatic implications for our food security and the natural world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4cf9b1df3742d8852f91efbe873fe19167c73297\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4cf9b1df3742d8852f91efbe873fe19167c73297/0_361_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Allnutt of the Small Robot Company at Meon Springs farm in Hampshire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Allnutt of the Small Robot Company at Meon Springs farm in Hampshire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In future, Rachel\u2019s creators explain, robots could take care of every stage of the growing process: mapping the land, planting seeds, caring for the crop, forensically weeding, then harvesting. She may currently do only the first job, but prototypes for the other tasks will arrive over the next couple of years.</p> <p>Ben Scott-Robinson, co-founder of the Small Robot Company, is a genial 44-year-old who talks about what he does with a Tiggerish enthusiasm. He is new to the world of agriculture and still surprised at what he has found. \u201cI expected farmers to be quite luddite about the adoption of new technology,\u201d he says, as he packs Rachel away. \u201cSome are, but there are a load of them who understand that new things need to happen.\u201d</p> <p>If food-growers embrace this new way of farming, it will end their dependence on a ploughing process that reduces the fertility of the land, and huge tractors that not only compact the soil but restrict growing seasons to times of the year when big machines won\u2019t get bogged down in mud. By tending crops at the level of the individual plant, robot farming will also lead to a big drop in the money farmers have to spend on pesticides. The developers claim they can increase arable farming revenues by up to 40%, and reduce production costs by as much as 60%. The agility of agricultural robots means small farms with compact fields will no longer be at a disadvantage; independent shops and restaurants will be able to grow their produce on smallholdings efficiently tended by Rachel-like machines.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>\u2018\u0007It could be used in the wrong way. You could have entire states in the US with no one in them\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There could be equally big environmental gains. Mega-scaled agriculture often leads to the ripping out of hedgerows, to pesticides contaminating rivers and streams, and soil erosion that can exacerbate flooding. The alarming decline in the number of bees in Europe, the US and beyond is linked to the use of insecticides; the equally sobering fall in bird populations has been traced to the same source. According to its prime movers, robot farming offers alternatives to all these things, and hope of an eventual ecological renaissance.</p> <p>\u201cMany farmers\u2019 main focus is to leave their business to the next generation,\u201d Scott-Robinson says. \u201cAnd because they go out in the fields every day, they\u2019re aware that they\u2019re not hearing thrushes and skylarks. They\u2019re aware that there are not so many bees, and pollination rates are going down.\u201d</p> <p>Scott-Robinson offers them not just a cure for these problems, but a new world of profitability. So what are the downsides?</p> <p>He cracks an awkward smile. \u201cErm\u2026 well, at the moment, we can\u2019t see any.\u201d</p> <p>Robots that milk cows are already a reality. So are digitised systems for feeding chickens. Robots that automatically move henhouses have been used in trials to keep birds well-exercised; for pigs and cows, there is an automated machine, produced by a company in Germany, that spreads straw around the sheds where they eat and sleep (\u201cUniform spreading up to nine times daily gives you an optimum utilisation of the straw\u201d promises its promotional blurb).</p> <p>In the US, automated harvesting of lettuces and strawberries is starting to become commercially viable. In France, robots prune grapevines, and are used for weeding and cultivation. All over the world, food production is gradually filling up with innovations that bring a new level of care and sophistication to the rearing of livestock, and the growing of crops.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b45297c99d20916a26c7350653b3d777c04eac6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b45297c99d20916a26c7350653b3d777c04eac6/0_1019_3992_4623/864.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Small farms, big opportunity\u2019: precision farming pioneer Simon Blackmore.\" width=\"864\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Small farms, big opportunity\u2019: precision farming pioneer Simon Blackmore.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What sets some of the British pioneers of robot farming apart is their ambition to mesh together the entirety of the growing cycle. This is why big financial players and institutions are starting to put money into inventions that, only four or five years ago, might have seemed laughably far-fetched: the Small Robot Company has so far attracted \u00a31m, from sources including the government agency <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/innovate-uk\" title=\"\">Innovate UK</a>, farmers who have invested in its technology, and the crowdfunder <a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/small-robot-company-green-agri-tech-farmbots#/\" title=\"\">Indiegogo</a>.</p> <p>The outfit is based in a tiny office in the bowels of Portsmouth\u2019s Guildhall. Two long desks are strewn with wires, circuit boards and components produced on 3D printers; when she is not out in the fields, Rachel is kept on a stand near a window. Fixed to the walls are artists\u2019 impressions of the models of robot conceived by the company\u2019s founders for the three pre-harvest stages of wheat-growing: Tom, Dick and Harry. Tom does the same job as Rachel: according to the company\u2019s website, he \u201clives on your farm and digitises your fields \u2013 he monitors them on a plant by plant basis, keeping track of the health and development of each plant\u201d. Dick \u201cmicro-sprays each plant with fertilisers or chemicals as required to help it thrive\u201d. Harry \u201cplaces individual seeds in the ground and accurately records where he has placed them\u201d. These three will be overseen by Wilma, the software system that \u201cextracts the information from our crop data model, and in combination with our AI software, helps you make decisions\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A laser bot can recognise 800 types of weed and destroy them with precision targeting</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Until 2016, Scott-Robinson was working for Ordnance Survey, using drones and artificial intelligence for the detailed mapping services that bring in the bulk of its money. He was alerted to the possibilities of robotic farming by an item on <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qj8q\" title=\"\">Radio 4\u2019s Farming Today</a> programme: when he discovered there were no British startups working in the field, he decided to found one himself, and concentrate on wheat.</p> <p>\u201cWheat is the largest crop in the world,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are three-quarters of a billion hectares of it. It\u2019s one of the biggest damagers of the environment, and one of the biggest areas we could improve to increase food production. And wheat makes it easy for us to go to barley, maize and corn, which are very similar in terms of the way they grow.\u201d He says the firm is approaching the point at which its innovations can be rolled out commercially: \u201cWe are going to have a full service in the next three years. Completely ready to go. Allowing for adoption rates, within the next three years, you are going to be able to drive around and see these machines in the fields.\u201d</p> <p>At the moment, the company is a tiny operation, employing just eight people. Because its innovations uncouple food growing from big machinery and huge fields, they should \u2013 in theory \u2013 allow small- and medium-sized farms to prosper, and strip vast agribusinesses of their competitive advantage. But what happens if he eventually sells out to some multinational conglomerate?</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what we\u2019re here for. My interest is not in starting a business to make shitloads of money and retire in five years\u2019 time. I have no desire to make the business into something that can be sold.\u201d</p> <p>But that\u2019s what most startups say. And most of them eventually sell out.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s true, yes. But if we were taken over by someone else, the outcome could be radically different, in terms of its effect on the world.\u201d</p> <p>This is the one note of darkness that enters an otherwise optimistic conversation. \u201cThis technology could be used in a completely different way,\u201d he says. \u201cYou could have entire states in America with no people in them. The potential for what we\u2019re doing to be used in the wrong way is there.\u201d</p> <p>What can he do about that?</p> <p>\u201cWell, we have a very, very strong ethos within the business about what we\u2019re trying to do. We\u2019re here to feed the world.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>In Britain, a lot of the ideas behind robotic farming have emerged from <a href=\"https://www.harper-adams.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Harper Adams University</a>, a big education and research campus on the edge of Newport, in Shropshire. I drive there on a baking-hot Wednesday to meet <a href=\"https://www.harper-adams.ac.uk/general/staff/profile.cfm?id=201049\" title=\"\">Prof Simon Blackmore</a>, the 64-year-old pioneer of \u201cprecision farming\u201d. The Small Robot Company is based on his work, and he is hailed by Scott-Robinson and his colleagues as a visionary.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"408ad74607d19c0223d96c2d5822c2caaae7b7a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/408ad74607d19c0223d96c2d5822c2caaae7b7a2/0_0_3735_2242/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Allnutt with Rachel, the robot he helped build\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Allnutt with Rachel, the robot he helped build: every three seconds, Rachel takes a closeup photograph of the plants and soil around her, which will build into a forensic map of the field.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Blackmore has worked on the automation of agriculture for 30 years, but his big breakthrough was triggered in 2004 when the US federal government\u2019s Department of Defense put on <a href=\"https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2014-03-13\" title=\"\">the first Grand Challenge</a>, in which inventors of driverless cars were invited to try to get them along a 142-mile route through the Mojave desert. \u201cThat stirred up so many people,\u201d he says. \u201cThe eureka moment for me was thinking, \u2018What\u2019s the Grand Challenge for agriculture?\u2019\u201d Over the next few years, he came up with the comprehensive seed-to-harvest concept the Small Robot Company is trying to put into practice, and started making the case for a radical transformation in the way we grow food.</p> <p>One belief runs through everything he says: that farming is still stuck in the 20th-century mindset that size matters. Crops are fertilised and sprayed with pesticides en masse; harvesting takes place on an industrialised basis, which leaves no space for judging, plant by plant, a crop\u2019s needs or readiness for harvesting. It\u2019s hugely wasteful. Other industries such as car manufacturing have gone through revolutions that have introduced new levels of sophistication and flexibility; as Blackmore sees it, it is high time farming did the same.</p> <p>He takes me on a tour of the university\u2019s robotics lab, where he points out a crop-spraying drone he says is illegal in the UK, but is successfully used in China. He ruefully shows me a self-driving lawnmower named Tommy he says would be ideal for golf clubs, but has yet to find a commercial backer. There\u2019s also a precision crop-spraying device called Norman (it seems no farming robot is complete without a whimsical first name). It fits inside a kitsch outer casing that looks as if it was created to break the land speed record.</p> <p>As we go, he explains an ongoing project called <a href=\"http://www.handsfreehectare.com/\" title=\"\">Hands Free Hectare</a>, now in its second year, which has successfully grown barley with no direct human involvement \u2013 using robot scouts that monitor the crop and soil, and self-driving combine harvesters \u2013 and has now moved on to wheat.</p> <p>Yet the fields and sheds around the university are scattered with symbols of everything Blackmore wants to do away with: tractors, produced by the huge companies he says have so far been barely interested in his work.</p> <p>\u201cThe reason why the tractor manufacturers are not developing robots is that they\u2019re into selling big bits of metal,\u201d he says. \u201cTheir whole mentality is, \u2018The next machine\u2019s going to be bigger than the last one.\u2019 They\u2019re not interested in something that\u2019s going to disrupt them. But the startup companies aren\u2019t concerned with continuing the things that have been done in the past \u2013 they can produce whatever they like.\u201d</p> <p>Blackmore talks about robot farming as a liberating, accessible technology. But what happens if it gets into the hands of agribusiness? What about that nightmare future of huge spaces devoid of human beings?</p> <p>\u201cMost people think this is going to be expensive, is going to do everyone out of a job and is going to be good for the big farms, not the small farms,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s actually the exact opposite. The big farms are all about economies of scale: big fields, big tractors. We are developing small machines. I believe the extra production we need to feed the planet is going to come from small farms that can\u2019t use those economies of scale.\u201d</p> <p>In Asia, Blackmore points out, the average size of a farm is around one acre. \u201cI do a lot of work in China now,\u201d he says. \u201cThe whole southern part has many of those small farms. And they now have a big opportunity to use robots.\u201d</p> <p>The most spectacular innovation Blackmore has worked on is laser weeding. The idea is simple, but mind-boggling. A farming robot, he says, can be equipped with software that can recognise up to 800 different kinds of weed, destroying them with precision targeting. At a stroke, chemical weedkillers would become yesterday\u2019s news.</p> <p>\u201cEverybody\u2019s interested in it \u2013 but we\u2019ve got the lead on it,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can send a laser weeding robot out into the field, and you don\u2019t need anything else to be there: it can work on a commercial farm today.\u201d This technique has been trialled; he says it will be introduced to British farms next spring.</p> <p>***</p> <p>\u201cSpace robots running around the fields with lasers, killing plants,\u201d says Paul Harter, chief operating officer of a startup called <a href=\"https://earthrover.cc/\" title=\"\">Earth Rover</a>, based in Somerset House in London, nudging the Thames. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing story.\u201d For him and the company he has worked for since 2017, it is also on the verge of becoming a reality.</p> <p>Earth Rover is another company that owes its existence to Blackmore\u2019s work. As the name suggests, its prototype robot takes some of its ideas from the British team who worked on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jul/12/spacewatch-martian-rocks-on-earth-a-step-nearer-as-uk-builds-red-planet-rover\" title=\"\">ExoMars rover</a>, an automated device that will be sent to Mars in 2020 as part of a joint Russian-European project. Their aim is to use such cosmic technology in the growing of organic broccoli \u2013 with lettuce, carrots and onions to follow.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In the US, robots harvest lettuce and strawberries. In France, they prune grapevines</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cSpace robots are simple, robust, unlikely to break,\u201d Harter says. \u201cSo it\u2019s quite a good match. The idea was, \u2018We\u2019ll take this robot, improve it, and create something agricultural. We\u2019re licensing some technology from them. Mark I was theirs, and we\u2019ve now made Mark II. We\u2019ve made it quite a lot cheaper.\u201d</p> <p>What do the two machines have in common? \u201cThe engineering principles \u2013 simple, mechanical solutions. If you look at how a Mars rover\u2019s suspension works, there are no springs: everything\u2019s just on rockers, and it uses gravity to keep the wheels stuck to the ground. Every wheel is independently steerable. So we use things like that.\u201d</p> <p>Earth Rover\u2019s laser weeding machine will start to appear on farms next year, with the automated harvesting of broccoli following sometime around 2021. Since the EU referendum, British food-growers have already experienced labour shortages, as the people who once would have come to the UK to work in the fields have stayed at home. This may have big repercussions for broccoli, which Earth Rover claims it will soon be able to solve.</p> <p>\u201cWeeding and harvesting are the two main labour costs with broccoli,\u201d Harter says. \u201cIf a field\u2019s got badly infested with weeds, they put 30 or 40 people in and they literally lie down on beds being pulled slowly by a tractor, and weed for eight hours, by hand. Harvesting isn\u2019t as arduous, but it\u2019s still a manual process.\u201d He pauses. \u201cFarmers are losing whole fields of crops because of labour shortages. There\u2019s an urgency and an appetite to automate these tasks. People are saying, \u2018We need another way to do these jobs, because we\u2019re losing the labour force we\u2019re dependent on.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>So if robot farming does strip some of the human element from farming, there may even be an upside. If there is a way to combine Brexit with a thriving UK food-growing industry, it might centre on small, intelligent machines zooming around the fields day and night, tending our food, quietly zapping whatever gets in the way.</p> <p>\u2022 Commenting on this piece?

However, you might break your back doing it, and it will certainly break your heart at some point, probably when slugs get involved. So, where do you start on this bumpy but bountiful road? Many would say radishes, because they give quick results for the impatient newcomer, but the truth is that the line between a crisp, peppery radish and a woody, pithy one is fine and easily missed. As for tomatoes, they are lovely when sun-warmed and ripe from the vine, but not if they have blight from a damp summer.</p> <p>The truth is, there\u2019s no such thing as a truly effortless crop \u2013 all edibles require some attention \u2013 but below are a few that are pretty foolproof as long as you do the bare minimum of watering.</p> <h2><strong>If you only have a windowsill</strong></h2> <p>The Lilliputian world of microgreens offers those with the smallest of spaces the opportunity to grow some crops with flavour as well as vitamins and other nutrients. Microgreens are merely seedlings harvested when they are no more than 10cm or so high and grown so close together that they resemble a small forest. You don\u2019t need proper pots or a seed tray: a yoghurt tub or a takeaway container will do, as long as you punch holes for drainage. Microgreens are a one-hit wonder, however \u2013 each cut is the end of life for the seedling \u2013 so you will need to re-sow every two weeks or so. When buying seeds, check the packages and hunt for those with the most inside.</p> <p>The entry level into this world, which is vast and runs from amaranth to watercress, is dried peas from the supermarket. Sow them cheek by jowl and cover with just a little compost. The flavour of just-harvested pea shoots is fresh and green, just as if you have been frolicking in a summer meadow. Once you have succeeded here, try the seedlings of radishes, cabbage, broccoli, mustards, Greek cress, basil, perilla (shiso) \u2026 The list is endless \u2013 even carrot seedlings are delicious.</p> <p>If you have a bit more space and a sunny enough spot, I would recommend getting a lemon tree or perhaps a kumquat. Not because you are likely to harvest bowls full of fruit, but for the leaves, which harbour all the flavour of the rind, but in a subtle and interesting way. They can be used in curries, puddings or \u2013 my favourite \u2013 gin and tonic. You could even add some coriander microgreens and truly up your game. Citrus trees need bright, warm conditions and watering twice a week in summer.</p> <h2><strong>If you have space for outdoor pots</strong></h2> <p>Whether they are on a balcony, in a courtyard or just by the back door, pots can offer growing conditions to match open soil, as long as there is plenty of good light and daily watering in the summer. The light bit is essential: too much shade and your crops will struggle. You need at least three hours of sunlight a day to get a decent harvest.</p> <p>Everyone wants to start with tomatoes, but you will get more bang for your buck buying a chilli plant. Chillies are greedy feeders and they may need housing in five- or even 10-litre pots so you can keep them satiated. Once they start to flower, give them organic tomato feed every other week and one or two plants will keep you supplied all year.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/aug/23/cooks-and-their-kitchen-gardens-bruno-loubet-thomasina-miers\">From fork to fork: five cooks and their kitchen gardens</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If you don\u2019t like chillies\u2019 heat, at the other end of the spectrum you could try dwarf French beans, which are very easy to grow. Mid-May is the perfect time to start sowing, then repeat-sow every two to three weeks till the end of July so you get a succession of picking right into early autumn. You want to harvest the beans when they are no thicker than a pencil, with just a hint of seed showing inside. The best variety <a href=\"https://www.seaspringseeds.co.uk/shop/french-bean-seed/faraday-detail\" title=\"\">I have found is Faraday</a>; the flavour is unbeatable.</p> <p>Each plant needs to be 15cm apart from its nearest neighbour. Sow two seeds per station, 2cm deep around the edge of a container so the beans can hang over the edge; this keeps them clean from the soil. Once the flowers appear, make sure you water well as this will help the fruit to set; other than that they will do all the hard work for you. If there\u2019s space in the middle of the pot, you could sow a bee-friendly flower such as calendula to encourage pollination.</p> <h2><strong>If you have soil</strong></h2> <p>The joy of soil is that it does the work for you. Plant roots can grow far into its depths and explore for minerals and nutrients, while friendly microbes help defend against pests and diseases. Establish a perennial by watering it regularly until you see signs of new growth, after which it will basically look after itself.</p> <p>I can\u2019t think of a better crop for soil than globe artichokes. These architecturally handsome plants have strong silver leaves that reach a metre or so in height, and tall flowerheads for you to harvest. A mature clump can give you up to 10 heads to eat every summer. You will find young plants for sale now; they take a year to establish, but after that you can be picking for many years to come.</p> <p>If you somehow tire of eating them, you can always make a version of Cynar liqueur by soaking the outer petals in vodka.

His artwork is distinctive for its bold design and graphic verve, the confidence and intensity of his line, a vivid palette and the successful capture of the continuum of life. Snapshots of the natural world \u2013 otters, bees, curlews, bluebells \u2013 executed with speed and the intensity of field sketches, coalesce into fully realised pictures of nature at large. </p> <p>His was a kind of subjective realism. He drew his animals and plants as they were (he was always interested in habitats too), but also as he experienced them. Many wildlife artists start out with art and find their subject; he began as a birdwatcher and wildlife observer and found art the only release for what nature stirred in him. He worked in the field, sprawled on the ground, with paper clipped to a card (no easel, no artist\u2019s stool) and often used twigs as his pens or brushes. Encamped in a Norfolk saltmarsh, he requisitioned old cornflake boxes to print miraculous images of the samphire at his feet and the oystercatchers in a creek.</p> <p>He gathered his material directly, but made his marks from memory, turning from the storm of life that he loved, and putting down on paper what of it, in his head, he knew and felt. On the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/18/country-diary-keeping-track-of-the-gannets-of-the-bass-rock\" title=\"\">Bass Rock</a>, off the east coast of Scotland, having stared long and hard at its breeding gannets (a species he had always regarded closely), he looked away from the mayhem of bickering birds on a guano-spattered cliff top and reproduced it in his own way. A <a href=\"https://www.mallgalleries.org.uk/whats-on/exhibitions/natural-eye-2016/gannets-bass-rock\" title=\"\">resulting monotype</a> gives as near to total gannet as seems possible. Fellow artists recall him napping among those gannets, having done his stuff, his paint box for a pillow.</p> <p>Animals are the oldest of all subjects, yet much recent wildlife art has been in awe of the real. Today\u2019s images of animals most often are photographs or somewhat clinical illustrations. Greg\u2019s art was utterly different, though no less accurate for all its subjectivity. As a birdwatcher, Greg had learned the jizz \u2013 the total combination of characteristics that serve to identify a particular species \u2013 of birds: his essence-gathering techniques showed he knew all about that. The nitty-gritty of the creature is in every picture and the viewer can always identify the species shown (unmistakably, a pair of simple blocky rectangles is a herring gull); but every picture also has Greg\u2019s indelible signature.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5047c78c59acda6d0c9387b0a1782a9822437d30\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5047c78c59acda6d0c9387b0a1782a9822437d30/0_0_985_591/500.jpg\" alt=\"Greg Poole on Bardsey Island, off the Welsh coast, working on the Flight Lines project in 2015.

I made the resolution to find a way of expressing what I was seeing as soon as I returned to Britain.\u201d</p> <p>Volunteering at <a href=\"http://www.bbfo.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Bardsey Island bird observatory</a>, off the coast of north Wales, Greg began drawing seriously there, then, in 1989, did an art foundation course at Manchester Polytechnic. For the rest of his life he scraped a living as an artist. He took commissions, journeyed to paint on behalf of <a href=\"http://www.artistsfornature.com/\" title=\"\">Artists for Nature</a> conservation projects \u2013 including to India (2000), the Catalan Pyrenees (2001) and the Hula Valley in Israel (2009) \u2013 made information panels for nature reserves and served on the council of the Society of Wildlife Artists. During this time he also exhibited and sold pictures.</p> <p>He sought the creative company of a few way-marking older artists, admiring John Paige\u2019s collages and the late <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/aug/12/david-measures-obituary\" title=\"\">David Measures</a>\u2019 butterflies (the two made <a href=\"https://gregpoole.co.uk/trips-projects/nature-in-art-2001/\" title=\"\">\u201cpush-and-pull pictures\u201d </a>together \u2013 shared work done on a single canvas), as well as a handful of like-minded contemporaries (<a href=\"http://swla.co.uk/wp-swla/members-list/kim-atkinson/\" title=\"\">Kim Atkinson</a> most significantly). Latterly Greg taught many painting courses outdoors, in particular at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jun/29/john-busby\" title=\"\">John Busby</a> seabird drawing course on the Scottish east coast for more than a decade. A tough and opinionated tutor, he was highly valued by those he schooled.

Converting a vegetable patch into a proto-meadow absorbed him almost as much as his artwork, capturing a pocket-ecosystem of bird\u2019s-foot trefoil, gatekeeper butterflies and a family of foxes. Susan and he attended to one another\u2019s apiaries, the \u201chotel\u201d he made for the solitary bees on their rewilded allotment, and the honeybees she kept in their garden. He painted and drew them brilliantly.</p> <p>Once or twice most years Greg travelled to make art elsewhere. He made trips using a camper van as a mobile hide in Namibia and South Africa. In 2008, he travelled with scientists studying the Ethiopian bushcrow to paint the bird, and in Senegal he documented landscapes used by migratory birds for the <a href=\"https://www.bto.org/science/migration/flight-lines\" title=\"\">Flight Lines project</a> (2014). This was followed two years later by a project in Essex to document the creation of a new nature reserve on Wallasea Island.</p> <p>Although his work was made when sitting still and \u201cdug-in\u201d, movement was in his art and in his attitude to life. Jazz was an early passion, but he also rejoiced in silence. He was serious about everything, but was gentle and funny too. There was playfulness in how he lived and in all his art: he was a rare bird.</p> <p>Greg is survived by Susan and by his brother Steve.</p> <p>\u2022 Gregory Poole, wildlife artist, born 26 October 1960; died 28 December 2018</p>", "wordcount": "1084"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "lifeandstyle/2019/mar/23/get-your-garden-and-its-wildlife-off-to-a-good-start-this-spring", "type": "article", "sectionId": "lifeandstyle", "sectionName": "Life and style", "webPublicationDate": "2019-03-23T10:59:06Z", "webTitle": "Get your garden and its wildlife off to a good start this spring", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/mar/23/get-your-garden-and-its-wildlife-off-to-a-good-start-this-spring", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2019/mar/23/get-your-garden-and-its-wildlife-off-to-a-good-start-this-spring", "fields": {"byline": "Jane Perrone", "body": "<h2>Flower power</h2> <p>As soil warms, it\u2019s time to plant perennials, but don\u2019t just impulse-buy the first thing you see that promises pretty flowers on the label.

Check them over for signs of trouble: if roots are coming through the bottom of the pot and the plant won\u2019t take up water, it\u2019s time to repot. If foliage plants have gone pale, floppy and mottled, that\u2019s often a sign of spider mite, a microscopic sap-sucking pest that you\u2019ll spot only via spatterings of tiny white grain-like eggs on the back of the leaves, plus webbing in the case of a major infestation. Quarantine the plant, wipe the leaves daily with a damp cloth and remove the worst affected foliage, spraying with <a href=\"https://www.gardening-naturally.com/sb-plant-invigorator?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI07ep8bTq4AIVb5PtCh20bg0CEAYYASABEgJgCfD_BwE\" title=\"\">SB Plant Invigorator</a> (\u00a34.99 from gardening-naturally.com) to help your plant get back to good health.</p> <p>Inevitably, there will have been houseplant casualties over the winter: if you\u2019re looking to buy something different, a new introduction to the indoor plant scene is <a href=\"https://www.crocus.co.uk/plants/_/artocarpus-altilis/classid.2000028171/\" title=\"\">ulu (</a><em><a href=\"https://www.crocus.co.uk/plants/_/artocarpus-altilis/classid.2000028171/\" title=\"\">Artocarpus altilis</a></em><a href=\"https://www.crocus.co.uk/plants/_/artocarpus-altilis/classid.2000028171/\" title=\"\">)</a>, available from Crocus, \u00a330.

They tend to make his work tricky to install.</p> <p>While he also makes film and sculpture, over the last decade Huyghe has become known for reimagining the artwork as ecosystem.

An eight-hour journey from London ended in a rain-soaked trudge through the German city of M\u00fcnster, to city margins where the urban fabric dissolves into a lacework of petrol stations, fast-food joints and leisure centres. Tucked behind a drive-through Burger King, Huyghe had excavated the concrete floor of a derelict ice rink and replaced portions of the ceiling with robotic hatches that opened and shut to the work\u2019s mysterious inner rhythms.</p> <p>Climbing down into the vast pit revealed an alien landscape, pocked and uneven: packed clay towers housed colonies of bees; algae grew in pools. On a platform in the middle was an aquarium housing a genetically modified <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GloFish\">GloFish</a> and a venomous <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conus_textile\">Conus textile</a></em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conus_textile\"> sea snail</a>. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HeLa\">HeLa cancer cells</a> divided, unseen, in an incubator.

Installed between compost heaps in a park in Kassel, Germany, the bees pollinated psychotropic, medicinal and aphrodisiacal plants \u2013 nightshade, jimson weed, rye, cannabis. Frogs croaked, ants hatched, Human acquired the ennui befitting an art-world celebrity, and the cycle of life rolled on.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2f3e02067991b03e05853f95471face1aad5c587\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f3e02067991b03e05853f95471face1aad5c587/12_404_4340_2203/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The dog called Human and the bee-encrusted statue in Huyghe\u2019s compost garden at Documenta.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"508\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The dog called Human and the bee-encrusted statue in Huyghe\u2019s compost garden at Documenta.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of the artist</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Human, alas, will not make an appearance in Huyghe\u2019s new work at the Serpentine. The star turn here is not animal, but artificial intelligence (AI), the processing of which we witness via five LED screens as it attempts to analyse events within the human brain.</p> <p>In January, Huyghe learned of a laboratory in Kyoto in which scientists were working on <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/12/28/240317\">deep image reconstruction</a> to decode complex visual information from human brain activity: artificial intelligence that can go some way toward working out what it is you\u2019re looking at or visualising. This machine telepathy uses data harvested during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which measures brain activity. After analysing this brain activity, the AI sorts through vast nets of example images already in its system looking for fragments of a match to help it determine what image the human subject was holding in their mind\u2019s eye.</p> <p>Huyghe worked with a man to whom he gave a set of interlinked images to visualise, some based on physical images, others that he invited him to imagine. The man pictured them one by one as his brain activity was monitored. What we see on the screens in the gallery is the AI moving through its exemplar images, sifting for echoes: we are looking not at the final result of the image reconstruction but a visible manifestation of the process of machine learning. Huyghe won\u2019t disclose what the original images were: it\u2019s up to us to decipher in turn what they might have been, and how they may be linked to one another.</p> <p>\u201cOf course as a visual artist it is very appealing \u2013 a new medium,\u201d says Huyghe. With machine learning he has generated an \u201cecosystem\u201d of a different kind, passing \u201cfrom a world that is constructed \u2013 with all the complexity and contingencies that go with it to evolve without me \u2013 to a world that can be imagined\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3721389d2dbd9d80ea919669378383fb915c6e35\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3721389d2dbd9d80ea919669378383fb915c6e35/0_0_1772_1772/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Think of an apple \u2026 visitors will find it hard not to interpret the AI-derived images at the Serpentine.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Think of an apple \u2026 visitors will find it hard not to interpret the AI-derived images at the Serpentine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: 2018 Courtesy of the artist and Serpentine Galleries; \u00a9 Kamitani Lab / Kyoto University and ATR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>AI's deep image construction is far from reality \u2026 a chimera made out of thousands of past images</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Rather than manipulating a physical environment, he is now, as he puts it, \u201cgardening\u201d in someone\u2019s mind. The work asserts its autonomy first in the perceptual gap between Huyghe and his human subject \u2013 if I tell you to think of an apple, the apple you think of will not be the apple I think of \u2013 and then in the analysis and image construction undertaken by the AI.</p> <p>While \u201cvery impressive\u201d, Huyghe warns that deep image reconstruction \u201cis far from something close to a reality or image that we know\u201d. What we see on the Serpentine\u2019s screens at any one time is \u201ca chimera made out of thousands of past images and the present images that are just there for a fraction of a second\u201d. Huyghe shows me a couple of clips on his phone. They\u2019re like something out of deep space or even deeper nightmare: a fleshy, suggestive sump, seething with traces of near recognisable detail.</p> <p>AI does not process images as a human brain might: there\u2019s no associative logic to what might emerge. Near-human intelligence that reveals itself to be subtly non-human is freaky. Huyghe and I discuss the idea of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/13/robots-human-uncanny-valley\">\u201cuncanny valley\u201d</a> \u2013 the zone occupied by entities that are nearly but not quite recognisably human. As humans we tend to find them particularly alarming. (Monster-makers for horror movies understand this perfectly; it\u2019s why the most disturbing monsters tend to have attributes that recall <em>Homo sapiens</em>.)</p> <p>Huyghe says the term \u201cuncanny valley\u201d came from \u201ca Japanese guy who was trying to make a kind of android\u201d. \u201cWhen you do 3D realism, you arrive at a threshold. That threshold is the moment where you\u2019re trying to reach realism but there\u2019s this tiny, tiny something that says it is not, and that\u2019s where the uncanny valley is. It puts you in a very excited mode, because there\u2019s something you start to have empathy with, and of course a part of you says you should not.\u201d</p> <p>Even without a 3D android as persuasive as the one in Alex Garland\u2019s film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/25/ex-machina-review-mark-kermode-alex-garland-vikander\">Ex Machina</a>, Huyghe\u2019s AI will invite intellectual empathy. Pattern recognition isn\u2019t only the preserve of machine learning: we humans do it, too, and we\u2019ll find it hard to resist interpreting the images as they evolve on the LED screens. However, just by standing in the gallery looking at them, we, as components in the Serpentine gallery ecosystem, will have an impact on the overall environment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d94073d9049cca10ccb913a540af20869a751490\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d94073d9049cca10ccb913a540af20869a751490/0_0_4480_6720/667.jpg\" alt=\"The artwork as eco-system \u2026 Pierre Huyghe.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The artwork as eco-system \u2026 Pierre Huyghe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ola Rindal</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then there are the flies. Along with the behaviour, movements and density of human visitors, a set of sensors installed in the gallery will also monitor the behaviour patterns of 50,000 bluebottles introduced into the space.</p> <p>Though 50,000 sounds akin to the fourth plague, the intended effect, curator Rebecca Lewin tells me, is something closer to an \u201cirritating August infestation\u201d. The flies will be fed sugar up in the rotunda, where they are expected to congregate. Unable to breed without the presence of protein, their stock will need replenishing over the course of the exhibition. Purchasing flies in bulk has been one of Lewin\u2019s more unusual curatorial challenges. Human visitors and bluebottles alike will trigger sensors in the gallery, feeding into a \u201cneural network\u201d that will change the pace at which the images on the screens evolve.</p> <p>Huyghe presents himself as an instigator, rather than author. That stance is in keeping with an ego-denting suggestion buried in the work \u2013 if deep image reconstruction can generate images from brain activity, it suggests that this brain activity and the images it generates are common to all of us: that something about our imagination is generic. In the field of visual art, that idea is humbling and not a little awkward. What if the mind is not what sets us apart from other people, asks Huyghe.</p> <p>Each of the complex, self-generating ecosystems Huyghe has constructed over the last decade reflects an existing set of real-world relationships. After ALife Ahead repackaged the struggle between the built human environment and the living world couched just beneath its crust. Within it coexisted organisms that were opportunistic (weeds, algae), alien (peacocks), genetically manipulated (GloFish), and mutating (cancer cells).</p> <p>At the Serpentine, a system structured around machine learning offers a controlled microcosm of the world we have just stepped out of, where algorithms predict our behaviour, tracking everything from search words to our physical movements. Of equal, if not greater importance perhaps: within this work, just as outside it, human behaviour has a profound effect on an environment that we share with other living organisms.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.serpentinegalleries.org/exhibitions-events/pierre-huyghe\">Pierre Huyghe is at the Serpentine Gallery, London</a>, 3 October \u2013 10 February.<br></p> <p><br></p>", "wordcount": "1530"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}, {"id": "lifeandstyle/2018/aug/26/seed-saving-to-grow-your-own-varieties", "type": "article", "sectionId": "lifeandstyle", "sectionName": "Life and style", "webPublicationDate": "2018-08-26T05:00:09Z", "webTitle": "The living lottery of seed saving", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/aug/26/seed-saving-to-grow-your-own-varieties", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/aug/26/seed-saving-to-grow-your-own-varieties", "fields": {"byline": "James Wong", "body": "<p>I was always an unusual kid. At seven my dream wasn\u2019t to grow up to be a fireman, astronaut or ninja, but a plant breeder. Having been read a children\u2019s encyclopedia entry about the prolific 19th-century American plant breeder, Luther Burbank, the idea that I could play Willy Wonka with plants somehow fired up my imagination. A definite case of early-onset geekiness.</p> <p>Yet, sadly, the reality of plant breeding is far more painstakingly methodical and boringly stats-driven than my seven-year-old self realised, not to mention expensive. Commercial breeders can take years to come up with breakthrough creations, growing tens of thousands of plants at a time, most of which never make it anywhere near becoming an interesting commercial variety.</p> <p>However, there is one fun experiment that gardeners can do at this time of year that could give you loads of new plants for free. It also offers a real chance of coming up with something exciting if the genetic lottery is in your favour: seed saving. For fruiting crops, simply keep aside some of the seeds, rinse them with cold water to remove any fibres of gel and then lay them to dry between sheets of paper towels. Once totally dry, these can be kept in sealed packets in a cool, dark place (even a fridge if you fancy) and planted out next spring.</p> <p>My best results have been for annuals such as chillies, tomatoes and physalis, or soft fruit such as strawberries, blackberries and raspberries, as their plants are very quick to mature. It means you won\u2019t be waiting years (or even decades), as with most tree crops.</p> <p>A second method to up your chances of getting interesting results is to pick seed from F1 or otherwise highly hybridised varieties. The mixed-up genetic heritage of these cultivars means their offspring are less likely to resemble their parents (what horticulturists call \u201ccoming true\u201d), but instead throw up more novel results.</p> <p>Want to go one better? Collect seeds from plants that are growing next to different varieties of the same species. Bees will probably have been busy swapping pollen in between all of these, which raises the probability of something weird and wonderful coming up.</p> <p>Now, if you were a professional plant breeder, you\u2019d be growing thousands of the offspring in the hope of picking just one or two with the desired traits. However, as this is just a fun backyard project, all you need to do is sow the maximum number you can get away with. I might sow 50 or so individuals, even if I only need five or six plants, and give the rest away to mates (of course with the instruction that if something cool comes up, I want a cutting). </p> <p>My homespun \u201caccidental breeding\u201d project run by simply collecting and sowing my own seeds each year has given me a lovely green-and-orange-striped cherry tomato with excellent flavour, and a dark purple raspberry \u2013 things that no one else has!

Predictably, <em>The Chase</em>\u2019s Bradley Walsh let the side down by being a straight white man.

In the light of the progress of these negotiations, I don\u2019t hold out much hope for the survival of the Melton Mowbray pork pie, let alone the continued existence of all the life on Earth.</p> <p>But while climate change experts were once derided as cranks, a kind of environmental <a href=\"https://theflatearthsociety.org/home/\" title=\"\">Flat Earth Society</a>, finally their message is believed.

The Doctor loves to help humanity but as a time traveller she must know that within a decade or so our whole race will be doomed.

Or going back to the dawn of time and preventing the clever troglodyte, Keith Flintsparker, the first fire-starter, from dipping a dry twig into a puddle of tar and flint-sparking it into fuel.</p> <p>The 1975 Tom Baker <em>Doctor Who</em> story <em>Genesis of </em><em>the Hateweed</em> explores this conundrum. In it, the Doctor finds himself in the laboratory where his future nemesis, the Hateweed, is being genetically engineered into existence. He holds the spores over a nearby toilet and eventually decides that flushing them down the bowl and destroying them would constitute too great an intervention in the timeline. Nicholas Parsons, in a rare serious role as the Hateweed\u2019s creator, Anglias the Weedseeder, watches him while eating a blue space pie, in an act of defiant indifference.</p> <p>In 1992, I worked with Baker on the BBC radio comedy series <em>The Inexplicable Worlds of Patrick Nimmo</em> and I loved pumping Baker for behind-the-scenes Who stash. Baker told me he had been professionally jealous of the popularity of the Hateweed with female <em>Doctor Who</em> fans and had intended to change the scene while filming by \u201cthrowing the fucking seeds into the toilet and doing a massive, fast wee on them and shouting, \u2018That\u2019s pissed in their chips!\u2019 But Nicholas Parsons said, \u2018You, Thomas Stewart Baker, are drunk,\u2019 and he said he would throw the space pie at me if I did a wee. I said, \u2018I may be drunk, but you are Nicholas Parsons and in the morning I will be sober.\u2019 We had a jolly good laugh and it was all forgotten over a few jars.\u201d</p> <p>I share a personal trainer with Bradley Walsh and so I went to meet him in <em>Doctor Who</em>\u2019s Cardiff studios on Thursday and asked him if he thought the new Doctor should intervene in the climate change catastrophe.

I look up to see the dog\u2019s bed, minus the dog, slowly migrating across the floor. I watch for a moment in mute horror, trying to summon my rational side.</p> <p>Eventually I realise the tortoise is propelling the bed from underneath, making his way toward the back door. He will do this every morning for the next few weeks \u2013 leaving his nightly resting place, or rather bringing it with him \u2013 in a premature bid for freedom.

I text back something about it being normal crow behaviour, although I have no idea.</p> <p>Two days later I am in my shed at sunset when a flash of movement catches my eye. The small window above my computer screen frames a rectangle of western sky, with a section of trellis running along its bottom edge.

Marie and Tony Newton\u2019s back garden is filled with summery colour: miniature mauve cyclamens, frilly red camellias, graceful hellebores, seasonal snowdrops and the bright green sheaths of bulbs promising more flowers to come. A few winters back, their first daffodil bloomed on Boxing Day.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s basically chaotic,\u201d says Tony of the new climatic normal. \u201cIt\u2019s non-stop flowers from now on. Winters are milder on average and there\u2019s every opportunity to have a riot of lovely flowers from December right through till spring.\u201d</p> <p>Deadly floods in Bangladesh, devastating wildfires in California, melting glaciers in Greenland, coral bleaching in the oceans \u2013 this is climate change in action. Highlighting far more benign changes in Britain, long blessed with a moderate climate, may appear trivial or downright insensitive. Our gentle extremes \u2013 the beast from the east, or summer 2018 being England\u2019s hottest ever \u2013 are far from drastic. But they still pose challenges, and there is more change coming.</p> <p>Britain\u2019s 27 million gardeners could be the canaries in our coalmine. How are gardeners experiencing climate change in Britain and how is it transforming our gardens? And can adapting our gardening styles mitigate the negative impacts of climate change?</p> <p>Marie and Tony couldn\u2019t see their garden when they first viewed the house in 1982 because it was covered by a snowdrift. In the years since, as their south-facing quarter-acre evolved from a children\u2019s play-space to a <a href=\"http://fourseasonsgarden.co.uk/www.fourseasonsgarden.co.uk/Home.html\" title=\"\">\u201cfour-seasons garden\u201d</a> with an all-year-round rainbow of flowers, shrubs and trees, they have witnessed the Midlands climate become steadily milder. Autumn frosts are much later, if they strike at all, and September is a summer month now. Their begonias continue until October. \u201cThat would never have happened in the past; we\u2019d barely get through September without air frosts,\u201d says Tony. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s warming up, you\u2019ve got to plan for the extremes. We\u2019re still going to get very severe winters and it will wipe out many gardeners\u2019 new species.\u201d</p> <p>They know about this only too well. Their garden features a jungle area of bamboo, palm trees, a banana tree and the stumps of several Tasmanian tree ferns. These ferns survived the winter of 2009, the coldest for 30 years, but a run of -15C nights and sub-zero days the following December killed them off. \u201cIt\u2019s a mortgage to replace them,\u201d grimaces Marie. Climate change is encouraging many gardeners to buy exotic plants but \u201cwe still need truly hardy varieties,\u201d says Tony. Their banana is wrapped in black cloth over winter. He ensures that whenever they add a shrub to the 3,000 in their garden it can survive at -15C. </p> <p>Marie and Tony\u2019s garden fared better during last summer\u2019s drought. Their clay soils retain moisture, which helps, but they didn\u2019t lose a single plant to the weather, despite being on holiday for two weeks. This may be because they are obsessive mulchers. Mulch is material added to the surface of the soil to increase organic matter and repress weeds. The Newtons have added 108 cubic metres of tree bark to their soil over the years; each year they also compost all their garden leaves and cuttings, reapplying this to their soil. This organic matter has steadily improved soil quality and, crucially, helps it retain moisture.</p> <p>When Liam Shoesmith, deputy parks manager of Truro city council, saw how dry 2018 summer\u2019s long-term forecast looked, he suggested the city\u2019s gardeners should plant succulents and cacti for their Britain in Bloom competition entry. \u201cIt was a bit of a joke really,\u201d he says. But the community group that organises Truro\u2019s displays took his advice. In what the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) described as the \u201ctoughest year for community gardening in 54 years\u201d, Truro\u2019s blend of exotic, drought-tolerant plants, including palms and Mediterranean herbs, serviced by a solar-powered rainwater-harvesting system, thrived. And <a href=\"https://reckless-gardener.co.uk/truro-wins-britain-in-bloom-2018/\" title=\"\">Truro won the Britain in Bloom competition</a> for the first time.</p> <p>Shoesmith is currently dispatching his team to mow parkland grass: milder winters mean Truro\u2019s grass grows all year round. He began gardening as a boy in the 1980s. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely milder and wetter,\u201d he says. \u201cThe difficult thing we have with the climate is the more changeable weather. Last winter was probably one of the wettest on record here and then we went into one of the driest summers. The capricious nature of the weather is very hard to anticipate and work with.\u201d</p> <p>We don\u2019t think of mild winters as extreme weather events, but <a href=\"https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/interesting/december2015_temperature\" title=\"\">December 2015 was the most anomalous month ever recorded</a>, 5.1C above average, and the warmest in the Met Office\u2019s central England temperature dataset, which stretches back to 1659. Shoesmith notices how pollinating insects, such as solitary bees, often emerge during these mild midwinters. If there are no flowers, and no nectar, they will perish. \u201cClimate change is a big issue and as gardeners we can all do our bit to help by planting the garden so it\u2019s flowering throughout the year,\u201d he says. \u201cWe all want that anyway.\u201d</p> <p>Wildlife-friendly gardening focuses on native flowers, but Shoesmith argues we have long had non-native plants \u2013 particularly in milder Cornwall \u2013 and many exotic species are just as attractive to pollinators. In general, Britain\u2019s 400,000 garden plant species provide genetic diversity, enabling more selection and breeding to adapt to future extremes. But Shoesmith also has a motto \u2013 \u201cdon\u2019t go silly buying too much frilly\u201d \u2013 because certain varieties of exotic flowers with lots of petals lose their nectar-holding sexual organs and so become useless for pollinators. Daisies, aconites, crocus, hellebores are good for winter-waking bees.</p> <p>Allotment holders are also adapting to the increasingly capricious climate. <a href=\"https://www.incrediblevegetables.co.uk/\">Mandy Barber</a> has turned to growing perennial produce on her plot in Ashburton, Devon. \u201cAnnual vegetables needed a lot more watering and it was touch and go whether they would make it last summer, but perennial vegetables have a lot more resilience to temperature changes,\u201d she says. Barber is experimenting with crops including Taunton Deane kale; poireau perp\u00e9tuel, a perennial leek; and <em><a href=\"https://www.incrediblevegetables.co.uk/hablitzia-tamnoides-how-to-grow/\" title=\"\">Hablitzia tamnoides</a></em>, or Caucasian spinach, which is grown in Scandinavia and can survive -25C. \u201cThe <em>Hablitzia tamnoides</em> plants go on for decades, they are like a rampant triffid, but you get a crop between February and June every year and the leaves are a bit like baby spinach,\u201d says Barber. She also propagates and sells these perennials.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"36670e3d2bbef873569326d8ea78e2142df1e46f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/36670e3d2bbef873569326d8ea78e2142df1e46f/0_0_2335_3508/666.jpg\" alt=\"Part of Truro\u2019s winning entry to the Britain in Bloom competition.\" width=\"666\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Part of Truro\u2019s winning entry to the Britain in Bloom competition.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Wileman/RHS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Every gardener I speak to agrees that milder winters are enabling more pests to survive and encouraging new pest species. Allan Trigg has been growing vegetables for more than 40 years and has an allotment in Chelmsford, Essex. \u201cThis is my little patch of England,\u201d he smiles. Fewer frosts means his fellow allotment holders plant out runner beans, sweetcorn and potatoes earlier. With an extended growing season, Trigg can grow more, and second crops, although last year he grew less because he was spending so much time watering his vegetables. The dry weather produced lower yields of crops such as potatoes. After 2017, his potatoes lasted him and his wife through to February; this winter, they were eaten by November. And allium leaf miner and leek moth are a growing problem. \u201cI used to grow loads of leeks but now I don\u2019t bother,\u201d he says. He pulls one up to show the damage below ground. \u201cWe never used to have this trouble years ago.\u201d</p> <p>In Walsall the Newtons are accepting of their growing losses to pests such as the lily beetle and the lace bug. \u201cIt went absolutely berserk after the hot summer,\u201d says Tony. \u201cI thought it was going to kill all the plants in the garden.\u201d Barber is beset by voles (which survive the milder winters), while in Cornwall, Shoesmith has noticed the spread of <a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?pid=512\" title=\"\">fuchsia gall mite</a> along the hedges. \u201cIt had the opportunity to come to Britain for decades, but only arrived this century because of the milder winters,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the same amount of frosts now and so we get many more fungal problems.\u201d</p> <p>These observations precisely match the more scientific language of <a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/science/gardening-in-a-changing-world/climate-change\" title=\"\">Gardening in a Changing Climate</a>, a 2017 RHS report that outlines the challenges \u2013 milder winters, more unpredictable extremes and more pests \u2013 posed by climate change. But the RHS also asks how gardeners might help save the planet. The way we garden is still sometimes part of the problem \u2013 using precious water in pursuit of a perfect lawn during a drought springs to mind \u2013 but it can be part of the solution. Gardeners can reduce carbon dioxide emissions, mitigate pollution and flooding, and help increase their neighbourhood\u2019s resilience.</p> <p>\u201cWater use in gardens is going to be a major issue in the future,\u201d says Alistair Griffith, director of science at the RHS. <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/london_environment_strategy.pdf\" title=\"\">London is forecast to require 100m litres </a><a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/london_environment_strategy.pdf\" title=\"\">a day more than it can supply in 2020</a>, with this deficit rising to 400m litres a day by 2040. The use of energy-intensive mains water on gardens is still socially acceptable and Britain lags behind more water-stressed countries where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jul/21/greywater-systems-can-they-really-reduce-your-bills\" title=\"\">grey-water recycling</a> is commonplace. But hosepipe bans could become perpetual for some regions in coming decades.</p> <p>Apart from using only rainwater \u2013 even a small balcony can catch and store rainwater with a mini-reservoir \u2013 Griffith recommends gardeners provide \u201cas much greenery as possible\u201d. He suggests planting hedges instead of fencing and planting trees. Trees not only dispel pollution but can alleviate flash flooding and provide shade for a home during heatwaves. Perhaps the most overlooked way gardening can benefit the climate is via the soil: adding organic matter (mulch from home-composting, not peat) can create a soil that stores more carbon and retains more water, also making gardens more resilient in flood and droughts.</p> <p>Griffith\u2019s final practical suggestion for climate-friendly gardening is to make everything permeable. Unfortunately, paving gardens for parking continues (in 2015, the RHS found that the number of paved, plant-free front gardens had tripled in 10 years from 1.5m to 4.6m). Even car park gardens can be permeable and planted with trees and shrubs around the edge. But, according to Griffith, people resist, citing a lack of time and a nervousness about failing at gardening. \u201cGardening is always trial and error,\u201d he says. \u201cGive it a go.\u201d</p> <p>Gardening won\u2019t stop climate change, but it could make our local communities more resilient when faced with extreme floods, heat \u2013 and mild weather. In troubled times, it is also a fundamentally optimistic gesture.</p>", "wordcount": "1761"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}, {"id": "commentisfree/2019/may/12/we-ignore-poverty-and-visit-ruin-on-the-planet-but-i-have-a-plan", "type": "article", "sectionId": "commentisfree", "sectionName": "Opinion", "webPublicationDate": "2019-05-12T05:00:22Z", "webTitle": "We ignore poverty and visit ruin on the planet.

And unless there is a significant policy shift north and south of the border, the <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/10029\" title=\"\">Institute for Fiscal Studies</a> is forecasting that more than a third of UK children will be in poverty by 2022. The charity\u2019s definition of child poverty is a reasonable one: \u201cIt means growing up in families without the resources to obtain the type of diet, participate in the activities and have the living conditions and amenities which are the norm in 21st-century Scotland.\u201d</p> <p>We are rarely more than a few weeks between revelations about another public health crisis in Scotland\u2019s communities. The causes are wearyingly familiar to all those who have been paying attention. The communities that bear the brunt of these crises are the same as those that did so a hundred years ago.</p> <p>So if no government north and south of the border over the course of the century has been able to effect enough change in the living (and dying) circumstances of these neighbourhoods, how on earth can we be confident they will take steps to stop us torturing the planet? According to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/06/human-society-under-urgent-threat-loss-earth-natural-life-un-report\" title=\"\">UN report last week</a>, about one million species of animals, plants and insects are facing extinction in the near future. No species, it seems, is considered too big or too plentiful to die.</p> <p>The pattern of irresponsibility mirrors that which characterises our efforts to end human poverty. We know what is required and we have the means to effect it. We even know the specific neighbourhoods and streets requiring most help to address poverty, while David Attenborough has told us exactly where to find the threatened species.</p> <p>We also know that if we don\u2019t improve our means of producing food and energy and take greater care in disposing of waste there is a real risk of irrevocably destroying the ecosystem that sustains the existence of animals and humans.</p> <p>I think we\u2019re also entitled to ask if there is a point at which we declare a state of emergency to rescue ourselves and our environment. Scotland could take the lead. This country imagines itself as providing a gold standard in caring for the environment. At the STUC conference in Dundee in April <a href=\"http://www.govopps.co.uk/nicola-sturgeon-pledges-to-deliver-scottish-green-deal/\" title=\"\">Nicola Sturgeon pledged to make Scotland carbon-neutral</a> and thus make it \u201ca healthier, wealthier and fairer nation\u201d.

It should take the form of a sort of national boot camp. Under this, the government would award itself special powers to impose a form of compulsory national service to save the planet and ourselves. It would apply to all over the age of 16.</p> <p>The following is a list of measures to get the ball rolling: no overseas travel (unless by boat) for two years. This would reduce our carbon footprint to around a manageable size four. It would also give an almighty boost to Scotland\u2019s tourist trade and the fragile economy of the Highlands and Islands. Lots of jobs would be created and hard-pressed families would save money by not going on ridiculous trips to Florida and Cancun they can\u2019t really afford.</p> <p>Compulsory beekeeping. Every Scottish family would be required to sign up to a national beekeeping register. This would enjoin them to volunteer for a minimum time each week looking after the wee furry fellas at the community beehive centre. We\u2019d not only save the bees, which are a key building block of our ecosystem, it would get the kids out, give them a sense of purpose and improve their mental health.</p> <p>Mandatory adoption of an endangered animal. Every Scottish family would be required to adopt an endangered animal and help pay for its welfare. I adopted a couple of amur leopards a few years ago called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/04/kevin-mckenna-leopards-and-other-animals\" title=\"\">Henrik and Lubo</a> for a very small annual consideration. Regrettably, I let it lapse but am now scanning the internet for other threatened beasties to help out.</p> <p>Leave the Munros alone (for a wee while at least). I think some of our wild and beautiful places deserve a break from the intense human behaviour they\u2019ve been subjected to over recent decades when Munro-bagging has become a chi-chi lifestyle accoutrement. I\u2019d limit permits to much more sustainable levels. To ensure we are all getting exercise the Scottish government must establish compulsory attendance at community Falun Gong sessions.</p> <p>Compulsory lights out. Every family would be required to spend one day a week without any form of energy supply. This would be monitored by smart meters and Alexa (who we all know is spying on us anyway).

Following previous findings on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/30/humanity-wiped-out-animals-since-1970-major-report-finds\">decimation</a> of wildlife, the overview of the state of the world\u2019s nature is expected to provide evidence that the world is facing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/10/earths-sixth-mass-extinction-event-already-underway-scientists-warn\">sixth wave</a> of extinction. Unlike the past five, this one is human-driven.</p> <p>Mike Barrett, WWF\u2019s executive director of conservation and science, said: \u201cAll of our ecosystems are in trouble.

The next year and a half is likely to be crucial because world leaders will agree rescue plans for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/mar/22/ukmiss-almost-all-2020-nature-targets-official-report-admits\">nature</a> and the climate at two big conferences at the end of 2020.</p> <p>That is when China will host the UN framework convention on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/03/stop-biodiversity-loss-or-we-could-face-our-own-extinction-warns-un\">biodiversity</a> gathering in Kunming, which will establish new 20-year targets to replace <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/oct/29/biodiversity-talks-ministers-nagoya-strategy\">those agreed</a> in Aichi, Japan, in 2010. Soon after, the UN framework convention on climate change will revise Paris agreement commitments at a meeting in either the UK, Italy, Belgium or Turkey.</p> <p>Watson, a British professor who has headed both of the UN\u2019s leading scientific panels, said the forthcoming report will delve more deeply than anything before into the causes of nature collapse, chief among which is the conversion of forests, wetlands and other wild landscapes into ploughed fields, dam reservoirs and concrete cities. Three-quarters of the world\u2019s land surface has been severely altered, according to the leaked draft. Humanity is also decimating the living systems on which we depend by emitting carbon dioxide and spreading invasive species.</p> <p>Watson said the authors have learned from attribution science, which has transformed the debate on the climate crisis by showing how much more likely hurricanes, droughts and floods have become as a result of global heating.</p> <p>The goal is to persuade an audience beyond the usual green NGOs and government departments. \u201cWe need to appeal not just to environment ministers, but to those in charge of agriculture, transport and energy because they are the ones responsible for the drivers of biodiversity loss,\u201d he said.</p> <p>A focus will be to move away from protection of individual species and areas, and to look at systemic drivers of change, including consumption and trade.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/23/greta-thunberg\">political environment</a> is changing in some countries due to overwhelming scientific evidence and increasing public concern about the twin crises of nature and climate, which have prompted more than 1 million students to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2019/mar/14/greta-thunberg-how-her-school-strike-went-global-podcast\">strike from school</a> and led to street protests by Extinction Rebellion activists in more than a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/27/extinction-rebellion-activists-stage-die-in-protests-across-globe\">dozen countries.</a></p> <p>The UK parliament declared a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/01/declare-formal-climate-emergency-before-its-too-late-corbyn-warns\">climate emergency</a> this week and the government\u2019s chief climate advisory body <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/02/do-it-now-uk-must-set-zero-carbon-target-for-2050-say-official-advisers\">recommended</a> an accelerated plan to cut carbon emissions to zero by 2050.

In early spring, you can cut them back in time for the new flush of growth.</p> <p>They grow 40-60cm high in a nice, neat clump that needs dividing only on their fourth or fifth year if you find they are taking up too much room.

The joke hinges on the idea that in real life ants are inconsequential compared with human beings. The world, we feel, could get on perfectly well without them, and still better without mosquitoes or any number of other creepy crawlies.</p> <p>This confidence is quite as mistaken as Kent Brockman\u2019s grovellings. Insects form the greatest part of animal life on Earth, and almost every other kind of animal depends on them \u2013 directly or indirectly. They pollinate plants and nourish animals, especially birds. In turn, everything that relies on these plants or animals depends on the insects. And the whole intricate web of interdependent exploitation is collapsing, and has been for decades. We ourselves are part of this web, in the long run quite as much dependent as exploitative.</p> <p>On the island of Puerto Rico, a rainforest preserved for centuries from human intervention shows <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2018/10/15/hyperalarming-study-shows-massive-insect-loss/\" title=\"\">a terrifying drop</a> in the abundance and variety of insects. Forty years ago, there were <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/10/09/1722477115\" title=\"\">60 times as many insects</a> on the forest floor as can be trapped today. The bird and lizard species that feed on insects have also been hit, if not to the same extent, falling by between a third and a half over the same period.</p> <p>The same trend is apparent in German nature reserves, where the number of insects appears to have dropped by about 75%; and these are results from places deliberately preserved, so far as possible, from human intervention. The collapse of insect life is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/21/insects-giant-ecosystem-collapsing-human-activity-catastrophe\" title=\"\">obvious to anyone who looks in Britain</a> \u2013 butterflies, bees and even the millions of chironomid midges that used to form plumes like smoke around the trees along the shores of reservoirs are all now mostly a memory. Car windscreens and headlights are no longer thickly speckled after any long journey.</p> <p>The causes of this global decline seem to vary with latitude. But they are all, in one way or another, the product of human activity. In the temperate regions insect populations are more adaptable to fluctuations in temperature, but insects must contend with the mass use of pesticides across the bleak monocultures of industrial agriculture, as well as the generalised pollution of the air and water. In the rainforest, where the pattern of losses across species and over time shows that there must be some single vast factor acting on the whole ecosystem, it appears that the main driver is simply the climate catastrophe. The consequences of this collapse lend still more urgency to political efforts to slow and eventually halt climate change; but even as individuals we can follow Candide\u2019s advice and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/shortcuts/2018/may/20/save-our-bugs-how-to-avert-an-insect-armageddon\" title=\"\">cultivate our gardens</a> so insects can thrive there.</p>", "wordcount": "501"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}, {"id": "lifeandstyle/2017/jun/17/plant-tiny-spaces-bees-butterflies-pollinators", "type": "article", "sectionId": "lifeandstyle", "sectionName": "Life and style", "webPublicationDate": "2017-06-17T10:00:35Z", "webTitle": "What to plant in tiny spaces to help bees and butterflies thrive", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jun/17/plant-tiny-spaces-bees-butterflies-pollinators", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jun/17/plant-tiny-spaces-bees-butterflies-pollinators", "fields": {"byline": "Sarah Shoesmith", "body": "<p>The loss of flower-rich habitat since the 1930s has taken its toll on our pollinators, but thoughtful planting of a plot even the area of the page that you are reading can make a world of difference to a bee.

In 2012, it was found in 160 colonies. This sounds plenty, but 60% of these numbered fewer than 10 butterflies, and the species had vanished from at least 260 sites since 1980. Extinction experts observe how endangered species enter a kind of death spiral in their final years, beset by disease, climate breakdown and cruel twists of fate. And the duke \u2013 its distribution falling by 84% since the 1970s \u2013 was relentlessly spiralling down.</p> <p>There is no direct connection between the prairie fields of oilseed rape and the duke\u2019s decline, but the symbolism is strong. \u201cInsectageddon\u201d has entered popular vocabulary, describing the terrifying loss of insect life upon which, ultimately, the complex web of life on Earth depends. A survey on German nature reserves found that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/18/warning-of-ecological-armageddon-after-dramatic-plunge-in-insect-numbers\" title=\"\">the abundance of flying insects declined by 76% over 27 years</a>, leading to warnings of an \u201cecological Armageddon\u201d. An analysis of global studies suggested earlier this year that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/10/plummeting-insect-numbers-threaten-collapse-of-nature\" title=\"\">more than 40% of insect species are declining</a>. Although some scientists have <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.14608\" title=\"\">criticised</a> this particular study as too imprecise, there is ample precise data on British butterflies, which have been scientifically monitored since 1976. Here, chemical farming and climate breakdown are increasingly recognised as key drivers of decline: widespread butterfly species declined in abundance by 58% on farmed land in England between 2000 and 2009, despite a doubling in conservation spending.</p> <p>In recent years, however, the duke has staged a miraculous comeback. Or rather, it has been revived by human action. Last summer, its numbers <a href=\"http://www.ukbms.org/docs/reports/2018/UK%20Summary%20of%20changes%20Table%202018.pdf\" title=\"\">increased by 65%</a>. This wasn\u2019t a seasonal fluke: the butterfly has bounced back in Kent, revived in Sussex and is booming in North Yorkshire, where its long-term trend is up 71%.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a species that has come back from the brink,\u201d says Dan Hoare of <a href=\"https://butterfly-conservation.org/\" title=\"\">Butterfly Conservation</a>. \u201cWe\u2019ve halted the slide towards extinction and in some landscapes it is genuinely marching back across the landscape. That\u2019s a real cause for celebration.\u201d Hoare, the director of UK conservation at this small charity, headed a programme to halt the species\u2019 extinction in Britain. The duke\u2019s caterpillars eat common wildflowers, cowslips or primroses, but the butterfly is oddly fussy: it doesn\u2019t like the open downs favoured by most warmth-loving butterflies, nor does it thrive in dense woodland. It requires lightly grazed grassland and scrub, or coppiced woodland.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ecf5c9a5a86fd2b4782e835b0a9d3764b0cb9e64\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ecf5c9a5a86fd2b4782e835b0a9d3764b0cb9e64/0_51_1500_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A closeup of the duke.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A closeup of the duke.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Iain H Leach/Butterfly Conservation</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Conservation scientists began to save the duke by first assessing the reasons for its disappearance from former haunts: 57% of extinctions were caused by \u201clack of management\u201d \u2013 too-shady woodlands or too-scrubby grasslands. But 27% of extinctions were caused by \u201cexcessive management\u201d \u2013 grassland grazed too heavily, or cleared of scrub. Ironically, these clearances were often funded by well-meaning conservation schemes to ensure that flower-rich chalk grassland remained free of bushes and trees. As Hoare puts it: \u201cThe duke doesn\u2019t like the way our conservation effort is funded, with grants awarded every 10 years to remove all scrub in one go. That\u2019s disastrous \u2013 dukes want scrub-removal little and often.\u201d</p> <p>When I call Dave Wainwright, who coordinates Butterfly Conservation\u2019s efforts to revive the duke in North Yorkshire, he is resting beneath a tree after reaching \u201cthree figures\u201d for dukes in a single day for the first time in his life. \u201cAfter last summer\u2019s drought, the caterpillars\u2019 foodplants were wilted and I was predicting all sorts of horrors this year, but I\u2019m counting very, very good numbers,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The effort to save the Yorkshire dukes began in the early 00s, with areas of hawthorn scrub cleared from steep-sided valleys to create a mosaic of suitable cowslip-rich grassland. Woodlands were also coppiced. The key, says Wainwright, was to connect existing habitat to new areas. Volunteers have also been crucial, monitoring numbers to show where the management is working and where it isn\u2019t. Esme Walton, 80, from Helmsley, North Yorkshire, encountered the duke while out walking one day, and began volunteering to record its numbers every week over the summer as part of the national <a href=\"http://www.ukbms.org/\" title=\"\">UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme</a>. \u201cThis little creature just fluttered up under my feet and I was enchanted,\u201d she says. \u201cThey look so fragile but they are very fierce territorial things. I\u2019ve seen them chasing butterflies twice their size. I get quite side-tracked watching the little shows they put on, the males spiralling up and up into the air.\u201d</p> <p>Data collected by Walton and others has revealed that the duke is now moving on to new areas of scrubby grassland made suitable for it. This \u201clandscape-scale\u201d conservation, creating \u201ccorridors\u201d through which wildlife can spread, is a contemporary conservation cliche, but the duke\u2019s expansion is proof that this connectivity actually works. Corridors in North Yorkshire, Sussex and Kent are being used by these fussiest of animals.</p> <p>This landscape-scale approach also helps the duke and other species adapt to the climate crisis. Dry spells imperil the butterfly by causing cowslips to wilt and die back before the caterpillars can feed up to maturity. Last summer was a classic example: eggs laid on hot, south-facing slopes failed as the plants died. But because the butterflies also laid eggs on cooler north- and west-facing slopes, their offspring are flying again this year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7733764300cfddf4c6bd5c7be8ee8b36618a1c22\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7733764300cfddf4c6bd5c7be8ee8b36618a1c22/0_259_5150_3090/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tree pipits have benefitted from the conservation work.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tree pipits have benefitted from the conservation work.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Arterra Picture Library/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201c\u2018Climate-proofing\u2019 is common sense in a conservation programme,\u201d says Hoare. \u201cWe\u2019re anticipating more extreme weather events, and the only way to mitigate against that is to build big, well-connected populations that are able to move around and respond.\u201d</p> <p>The duke\u2019s revival may be heartening, but can we really halt Insectageddon one species at a time? Phoebe Miles, a Natural England ecologist who works on the <a href=\"https://naturebftb.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Back from the Brink</a> programme, which is saving 20 endangered species and their landscapes, including the duke, says some individual species trigger emotional responses \u2013 leading to funding, volunteering and other action from the public.</p> <p>\u201cYou get a lot further focusing on the beautifully named and beautiful-by-nature Duke of Burgundy than you would focusing on, say, fine-leaved sandwort, which would also benefit from restoring the duke\u2019s limestone grassland habitat,\u201d she says. \u201cSingle species conservation allows us to hook into human emotion, whether it\u2019s wonderment watching a Duke of Burgundy hopping from flower to flower, or empathy and pity for the <a href=\"https://naturebftb.co.uk/the-projects/cornish-path-moss/\" title=\"\">Cornish path moss</a>, which persists at only two sites in Cornwall \u2013 about 0.16 square metres in total \u2013 and nowhere else on Earth. While it\u2019s not beautiful or charismatic, the sheer valour and humility of the moss\u2019s desperate fight for survival might just win our affection, and ignite our duty of care for other small, silent plants and animals.\u201d</p> <p>Besides, as Miles points out, every single species conservation effort has helped other species, from the RSPB\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.rspb.org.uk/our-work/conservation/projects/cirl-bunting-project\" title=\"\">resurrection of the cirl bunting</a>, which also benefited skylarks and linnets, to saving the <a href=\"https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/greater-sage-grouse\" title=\"\">greater sage-grouse</a> in the US and Canada. This single-species project restored sagebrush, one of the biggest communities of species in the western United States, and improved the fortunes of other declining species such as mule deer and the sagebrush sparrow. The work to save the duke is also benefiting the grizzled skipper, dingy skipper and green hairstreak butterflies, as well as adders and tree pipits.</p> <p>Saving the duke has not, however, halted the decline of more widespread insects \u2013 the butterflies and bees that people notice are missing from their gardens. These disappearances are driven by \u201chuge policy-level decisions with agri-environment schemes, neonicotinoids and other pesticides, atmospheric nitrogen pollution and climate change,\u201d says Hoare, \u201cand require government intervention, intervention in global markets and the lifestyle decisions of individuals. But I would passionately argue that the UK is better off for having the Duke of Burgundy. Species-based conservation offers hope and shows people they have a choice about the sort of world they want to live in.\u201d</p> <p>My tour of Wiltshire with Giles Wood is on an overcast day, and we fail to see any of \u201cthis punchy little butterfly\u201d, as Wood admiringly calls it. Two weeks later, Wood triumphantly sends me a picture of a duke he has just spotted. Its return to England\u2019s downs has a lesson for him. \u201cOut of all the fog, it shows us that the future of the world\u2019s wildlife entirely now depends on us.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was corrected on 28 May 2019.

I like honey, bees like honey. I don\u2019t much like being out on cold, wet days, and neither do they. We\u2019re a match made in floral heaven. There have been times when I\u2019ve blundered through our relationship, but getting honeybees made a lot of sense \u2013 and changed my relationship with honey.</p> <p>It seemed the next logical step in growing your own. I also liked the idea of being in charge of so many. I can\u2019t have a herd of cows in the city, or fit even one goat in my space, but I could have 30,000 or so individuals to look after, get free honey and maybe make a few candles.</p> <p>It turns out all my preconceptions were wrong. You\u2019re never in charge of bees: at best, you tend to their world, but mostly they do their own thing. Honey isn\u2019t free: beekeeping has a price \u2013 the hive, the equipment \u2013 but the true price is how hard the bees work. (There\u2019s no beating around the bush: we <em>steal</em> our honey from bees.) It\u2019s been a privilege to peer into my bees\u2019 world, one I shouldn\u2019t plunder, so last year I took just a 10th of their store, left them the rest and they came through winter on their own honey.</p> <p>Steve Benbow, who runs <a href=\"https://thelondonhoneycompany.co.uk/\">the London Honey Company</a>, is my bee mentor. We met at a book festival and it was another great match: he needed more flowers for his bees and I wanted to learn how to look after a hive. He gave me my first set of bees and built me a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_top-bar_hive\">top-bar hive</a> to house them. In return, I helped him build a wildflower garden to feed his bees, and all the other pollinators, too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"485fbe6c373269590e5f49597cc968c93ca1d4db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/485fbe6c373269590e5f49597cc968c93ca1d4db/0_365_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alys Fowler learns the ropes from Phil Chandler.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alys Fowler learns the ropes from Phil Chandler.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve J Benbow</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I am persevering with that top-bar hive, in which the bees make their own wax frames along thin, wooden bars. I do a bit of wax shepherding (bending wonky new wax so it sits straight on the bar), but the queen moves about as she pleases and there is minimal manipulation of the bees. Plus, top-bar hives are cheap and easy to make.</p> <p>My honeybees have also changed the way I garden. Once, I was mostly concerned with how humans perceived my space; now, I think of the insects foremost. For much of spring, my allotment was a beautiful sea of forget-me-nots. Wild flowers and weeds such as buttercups are hugely beneficial to pollinators, because they offer long-flowering periods of both nectar and pollen. Instead of managing my allotment largely by hoe, I now use shears, cutting and composting huge volumes of material to stop flowers setting seed, and rotting it down in buckets of water so my compost heap doesn\u2019t become too weedy.</p> <p>I\u2019ve never made so much compost and, in a lovely twist, each of my bins now has a large bumblebee nest in it. I went to fork one bin into the next and heard a roar: a nest of <a href=\"https://bumblebeeconservation.org/about-bees/identification/common-bumblebees/\">buff-tailed bumblebees</a>, If this means I have to wait until the end of the summer to tidy my compost, so be it. By autumn, the nest will be over: only the queen overwinters, and all the workers will die at the end of the year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"729c559a395d2a8d962c6cd15f287ca9791b19b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/729c559a395d2a8d962c6cd15f287ca9791b19b0/0_0_3648_5472/667.jpg\" alt=\"Alys gets to know her bees.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alys gets to know her bees.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve J Benbow</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Pollinators, be they honeybees, bumblebees, solitary bees, wasps, butterflies, moths or flies, need both pollen and nectar. Pollen provides protein and nectar carbohydrates. Honeybees and some bumbles fly on warm days in winter, so require year-round food: not much, but winter-flowering shrubs and early spring bulbs can make a big difference. They also need a source of clean water and somewhere to nest. The water could be a pond, bird bath or water butt with a landing stage: marginal plants in a pond, sticks in a butt or bird bath.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jun/17/plant-tiny-spaces-bees-butterflies-pollinators\">What to plant in tiny spaces to help bees and butterflies thrive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Your bees\u2019 nesting site could be a bee hotel but, as my compost heap attests, an undisturbed space works just as well: a dead hedge of sticks and twigs, say, or just a quiet corner. Being mindful not to clear up every last bit of dead material and leaf is as vital as any fancy hotel, though. If you do take the hotel route, position it somewhere sunny, facing south-east or south, and sheltered from rain. It must be at least 1m off the ground with no vegetation obscuring the tunnel entrances. Make sure it\u2019s firmly fixed, too, so it doesn\u2019t sway in wind.</p> <p>Finally, don\u2019t use any synthetic chemicals in your garden: no fungicides, insecticides, pesticides or herbicides, all of which can damage pollinators and potentially linger in the soil for years.</p> <p>\u2022 Letters To A Beekeeper, by Alys Fowler is published by Unbound at \u00a320.

However, for lazy gardeners like me there is a group of trees and shrubs that will literally decorate themselves, as if by magic, adorning their branches with shiny red baubles every year, perfectly in time for the holiday season. No struggling with cables, messing with electrics or boring clean-up come January. They are also a magnet for wildlife during the colder months. You might just call them a Christmas miracle.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>No struggling with cables or electrics, no boring clean-up come January. It's a Christmas miracle!</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Given that they are easy to grow, widely available and inexpensive to buy, it\u2019s a real surprise they aren\u2019t more common Christmas presents, especially since now is a perfect time to plant one. With that in mind, here are my top three choices for shrubs and trees that could be part of your Christmas tradition for years to come.</p> <p>Walking around my neighbourhood last week I was stopped dead in my tracks by the glossy red orbs of the ornamental crab apple <a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/Search?query=Malus%20robusta%20%E2%80%98Red%20Sentinel%E2%80%99\"><em>Malus robusta</em> \u2018Red Sentinel\u2019</a>, a stunning small tree whose scarlet fruit are so intensely coloured they look like they are lit from within. With added bonuses of beautiful, fragrant white blossom in spring and golden leaves come the autumn, this variety really earns its keep. And growing to just 5m tall, it is small enough to fit into most pocket-sized spaces without taking over.</p> <p>If it is more of a shrub you are after, <a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/Search?query=Cotoneaster%20%E2%80%98Cornubia%E2%80%99\"><em>Cotoneaster</em> \u2018Cornubia\u2019</a> in my experience provides the best of both worlds. It has lovely bright red fruit, too, produced in neat little bunches, set off by leaves that turn crimson in the autumn, but can be trained as anything from a neat hedge to a standard tree simply by how you choose to prune it. Just like crab apples, they produce loads of pretty white flowers in spring that are much loved by bees as well as providing a welcome supply of fruit for hungry birds in winter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"576cbf782d0c6deef90e71daa716f9c6f0f908ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/576cbf782d0c6deef90e71daa716f9c6f0f908ba/142_767_4384_2630/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Watch the birdy: a robin gets its beak around a Cotoneaster berry.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Watch the birdy: a robin gets its beak around a Cotoneaster berry.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But what if architectural structure if more your thing? <a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/Search?query=Cornus%20sanguinea%20%E2%80%98Magic%20Flame%E2%80%99\"><em>Cornus sanguinea</em> \u2018Magic Flame\u2019</a> does exactly what it says on the tin. Come the winter this small, mild-mannered green shrub starts to show its true colours, with leaves turning to butter yellow, burnt orange and fiery red. But it is when the leaves fall that the true drama is revealed. A nest of yellow, upright stems topped with bright red tips gives the whole plant the look of a shrub ablaze. With regular pruning these rarely grow more than 2m, offering up a whole lot of drama in a tiny space.</p> <p>If you have the space, however, why not plant all three? They\u2019ll give you loads of material for homemade wreaths, indoor decorations and gifts for decades to come in exchange for mercifully little work.</p> <p><em>Email James at <a href=\"mailto:james.wong@observer.co.uk\">james.wong@observer.co.uk</a> or follow him on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Botanygeek?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@Botanygeek</a></em></p>", "wordcount": "492"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}, {"id": "theguardian/2018/mar/27/notes-queries-special-garden-plant", "type": "article", "sectionId": "theguardian", "sectionName": "From the Guardian", "webPublicationDate": "2018-03-27T13:58:18Z", "webTitle": "Is there a garden plant or shrub that is extra special for you?

I\u2019ve found myself listening to the Vangelis score constantly for a sense of calm. There\u2019s something in the imagery of that movie, and the questions about who is human and who is android, that feels really relevant to me when I think about how we view empathy these days. It has made me think about noir as a genre: this idea of a protagonist who is part of a corrupt world, but also implicated in it. I somehow relate to that.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"59e2051aaef5be7a36cb4183a64f6ff3eb2db837\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59e2051aaef5be7a36cb4183a64f6ff3eb2db837/0_0_759_1173/647.jpg\" alt=\"Edward Said\u2019s Representation of the Intellectual\" width=\"647\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>2.

As a musician we don\u2019t classify necessarily as intellectuals, but I think when you\u2019re a public figure doing interviews there starts to be a sense of responsibility to give voice to certain things. I got a lot out of reading about Said\u2019s ideas of the role and responsibility of the public intellectual: that it\u2019s a person who\u2019s independently, without being co-opted by corporations or the government, conveying a message to and for the public, especially as a voice speaking in regards to underserved people.</p> <h2>3.

Since the heatwave summer of 1976, we have lost around half of our abundant butterflies \u2013 the generalist species found in gardens, parks and countryside all over the UK \u2013 and three quarters of our habitat specialists \u2013 those butterflies that rely on rarer plants and settings for their food. As with wild birds, intensive farming is the main cause, with recent evidence suggesting that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/27/eu-agrees-total-ban-on-bee-harming-pesticides\" title=\"\">the introduction of neonicotinoid pesticides in the 1990s</a> may also have been a factor.</p> <p>It\u2019s not all bad news: broadly speaking, British butterflies are thought to be among climate change\u2019s winners, because the UK is in the northern range of most of the 59 species that live here, meaning rising temperatures can enable them to move into new territory. This summer the marbled white, purple emperor and black hairstreak are doing well, while the warm spring provided a boost for the most endangered of all British butterflies: the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/02/dry-uk-weather-conditions-boosts-rare-butterflies\" title=\"\">high brown fritillary</a>.

But the count \u2013 run by the charity Butterfly Conservation, which is 50 this year and also focuses on moths \u2013 produces valuable information about how&#xa0;butterflies are doing in green spaces such as urban gardens that conservationists are usually unable to access. </p> <p>The delicacy and glorious colour of butterflies, and their metamorphosis from creepy-crawly to gorgeous, fluttering flight, has won them far more affection and prominence in human minds than other insects. Because of the long tradition of collecting and observing them, British butterflies are the most studied group of insects in the world. Though&#xa0;ants, bees and others have their champions, this realm of the animal kingdom is often overlooked by humans, and sometimes disliked.

The label organic, or bio, is a familiar one in many supermarkets, but makes up only 2% of food sales in the UK and about 5.5% in the US.</p> <p>Organic farmers must adhere to strict rules on how they grow their crops and raise their livestock. These include using antibiotics on animals only when necessary, cutting out chemical fertilisers and pesticides almost completely in favour of natural alternatives such as manure and wood ash as fertilisers and plant-derived pesticides, and managing land to provide habitats for wildlife.</p> <p>Rob Percival, head of policy at the Soil Association, says organic farming can feed the world, if consumption patterns are adjusted to encourage those who can afford meat to eat less of it. \u201cWe need an urgent shift in both production and consumption if we\u2019re to avert the worst consequences of climate change, including a dietary shift towards less and better meat,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cLivestock grazing on pasture can support soil health and carbon sequestration, and manure can provide soil fertility for other crops.\u201d</p> <p>He adds that the productivity of organic farming is greater than previously thought, \u201cand when the environmental and other damage caused by high energy and chemical inputs in non-organic farming are factored in, organic food is cheaper for society and better for the planet\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9eac83004e95aed1609e4717aa38dc6d766a754f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9eac83004e95aed1609e4717aa38dc6d766a754f/0_39_3153_1893/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A march for agroecology and civil resistance against seed and pesticide maker Monsanto in Bordeaux, France.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A march for agroecology and civil resistance against seed and pesticide maker Monsanto in Bordeaux, France.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Georges Gobet/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>But isn\u2019t organic a burden for farmers?</h2> <p>For many farmers, the investment and time needed to meet organic standards may be a stretch, but there are ways to move towards more sustainable farming without organic certification.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/briefing-boxes/farming-one/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Box 1\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/briefing-boxes/farming-one/embed.html\">Box 1</a> </figure>  <p>Agroecology is the name given to a broad range of farming techniques that seek to minimise the environmental impact of farming. It encompasses organic farming, but is informal and does not require certification and inspection.</p> <p>\u201cIt is about using natural systems,\u201d says Vicki Hird, food and farming campaigner at Sustain, an NGO. \u201cReducing the use of artificial chemicals, such as fertilisers and pesticides is an important part of it. Looking closely at the soil and other conditions, nourishing the soil, taking account of the natural pest cycles, natural predators and crop cycles.\u201d</p> <p>She argues that agroecology could be widely adopted as an alternative to damaging industrialised farming. Farmers can sow crops such as clover as cover to suppress weeds and return organic matter to the soil, and rotate crops, including vegetables such as legumes that fix nitrogen. It requires close attention to the land itself and the crops, rather than the standard mode of farming which is to plant cash crops at the highest yield possible.</p> <p>\u201cDiversity is the key,\u201d says Hird. \u201cHaving these huge monocultures does not lend itself to being managed in a natural way, and can damage biodiversity.\u201d</p> <p>Diversifying into heritage crops, such as older varieties of fruit and vegetables and a wider variety of grains than the current few strains of wheat that are the norm in intensive agriculture, can also yield benefits. These crops have their own advantages, including natural resistance to certain diseases, pests or conditions.</p> <p>\u201cYou might get a lower yield [by these methods],\u201d Hird concedes, \u201cbut you get a higher level of nutrients in the food produced.\u201d</p> <h2>What about permaculture?</h2> <p>Some farmers go further, and embrace concepts such as permaculture and biodynamics. The principles of permaculture involve understanding the relationships between plants and using them in combinations, while reusing any waste products, often as fertiliser.</p> <p>Biodynamics takes a different approach, following the precepts of Rudolf Steiner and incorporating a spiritual aspect, for instance in some cases aligning planting and harvesting to lunar calendars.</p> <p>Peatlands, which around the world have been grossly degraded, can also be managed organically through paludiculture. This requires re-wetting dried-out peatlands and looking to alternative plants that grow well there, including forestry and medicinal plants such as sphagnum moss, and allowing animals to graze.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8b32d13c598fed608d3ca8eed2b034e93a63a59f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b32d13c598fed608d3ca8eed2b034e93a63a59f/0_0_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Urban Farming Huruma Nairobi Kenya 022\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Urban farming, shown here in Nairobi, Kenya, produces a fifth of the world\u2019s food.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luis Tato/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>And urban farming?</h2> <p>Urban farming can deliver food \u2013 or at least some fresh produce \u2013 efficiently to dense populations without the greenhouse gas emissions and nutrient loss associated with transporting it across long distances. Already, urban farming produces about a fifth of the world\u2019s food.</p> <p>There are currently more than 3,000 urban farming schemes in London alone. These carry an echo of the \u201cmarket gardens\u201d and dairies of the Victorian era, when small vegetable farms were sited in or near towns and cows were kept in green places in cities for fresh milk.</p> <p>The cows of Hyde Park, dispensing fresh milk to Londoners, were a familiar sight until the first world war; in the near future, look out for hipsters drinking smoothies from the underground farms of Shoreditch.</p> <h2>These sound a bit niche. Don\u2019t industrial farms produce most of the world\u2019s food?</h2> <p>No. There are more than 570m farms worldwide; more than 90% are run by an individual or family and rely primarily on family labour. They produce about 80% of the world\u2019s food.</p> <p>Small farmers will be key to the transition, says Ronald Vargas, soil and land officer at the FAO. Many small farmers are poor and insecure, but FAO considers investment in smallholder production \u201cthe most urgent and secure and promising means of combating hunger and malnutrition, while minimising the ecological impact of agriculture\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2618d3f47bcac9cbcb4b394fa87e7deee22bc196\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2618d3f47bcac9cbcb4b394fa87e7deee22bc196/85_0_3854_2313/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A weeding robot\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A weeding robot at an agricultural research organisation in Saint-Hilaire-en-Woevre, eastern France. \u00a8</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jean-Christophe Verhaegen/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>How can technology and innovation help?</h2> <p>There is no shortage of innovation and tech to help improve efficiencies and yields \u2013 on industrial farms and smallholdings. GPS, drones and fine-grained data on topography, soils and other aspects of farmland to allow farmers to target specific areas with fertilisers, pesticides and water, instead of blanket spraying.</p> <p>For instance, Olam, a global agribusiness that produces cocoa, coffee, sugar, cotton and other crops, uses real-time monitoring on its plantations to finely judge fertiliser quantities and avoid the need for the pre-emptive use of pesticides. Its almond trees in Australia are fitted with sensors to monitor exactly how much water each tree needs, and when.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/briefing-boxes/farming-two/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Box 2\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/briefing-boxes/farming-two/embed.html\">Box 2</a> </figure>  <p>For family farmers in the developing world, mobile phones are revolutionising what is possible. They have given farmers in remote areas access to tools such as weather forecasts, market prices, yield information and practical advice. GPS is also allowing them to track their produce after it leaves the farm.</p> <p>Drones and robots may seem futuristic but are already in use, delivering targeted pesticides and picking out damaged or diseased crops before they can infect others around them.</p> <p>In parts of the world where space is at a premium, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/feb/06/vertical-farming-explained-erik-murchie\">vertical farming</a> is catching on. This refers to the practice of stacking crops, usually vegetables, in shallow containers in layers, which can reach any height available. It not only saves on space, but can also be managed to use water and energy more efficiently, as water can be pumped to the top and allowed to flow down by gravity.</p> <p>Some systems use hydroponics, by which the plants are immersed in water containing mineral solutions, in place of soil. Temperatures can be carefully controlled, water reused, and nutrients recycled. Software systems can control the delivery mechanisms and monitor how the plants are faring.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTKuOvoIXsU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dTKuOvoIXsU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Beating the drought in Egypt</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Our new-found abilities to control light, temperature, air and other environmental factors open up new vistas for farming. Underground growing used to be reserved for mushrooms and niche crops such as forced rhubarb, grown in large warehouses.</p> <p>If LEDs can take the place of sunlight, a far greater variety of plants can thrive in these conditions, making not only rooftops but basements and disused underground spaces from worked-out mines to old railway lines potentially viable venues for growing short-cycle foodstuffs.</p> <h2>What next?</h2> <p>Our reliance on artificial fertiliser and intensive farming techniques did not happen overnight, but took decades. Along the way, these methods revolutionised farming and enabled huge population growth and economic growth. We now have a wealth of scientific evidence that shows that continuing down the same path would risk runaway climate change, the extinction of species vital to human life, pollution of our water and air, and the death of our soils.</p> <p>\u201cIndustrial agriculture exploits the available natural resources of our planet to an untenable and unsustainable extent,\u201d says Vargas of the FAO. \u201cThe basic strategy to replace human labour with farm machinery, agrochemicals and fossil energy is a dead end in times of climate change, dwindling oil reserves and over-exploited natural resources.\u201d</p> <p>Experts say a second revolution is now needed, that will encompass not just our growing methods but consumption habits and our entire food economy. This would have to involve farmers, retailers, governments and consumers. In last century\u2019s farming revolution, only one future was offered: industrialisation. For this century, there will be a plurality of alternatives, and combinations of new and ancient technology, and all have their place.</p> <p>\u201cThere is not one huge conceptual change where you do everything differently and everything will be OK,\u201d says Tim Searchinger of Princeton University and the World Resources Institute. \u201cThere is not one single answer.

The start of summer is the time of year when the nation\u2019s insects should make their presence known by coating countryside windows with their fluttering presence, and splattering themselves on car windscreens. But they are spectacularly failing to do so. Instead they are making themselves newsworthy through their absence. Britain\u2019s insects, it seems, are disappearing.</p> <p>This point was underlined last week when <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisGPackham/status/1003377683009556480\" title=\"\">tweets from the naturalist and TV presenter Chris Packham</a> went viral after he commented on the absence of insects during a weekend at his home in the New Forest. Packham said he had not seen a single butterfly in his garden, and added that he sleeps with his windows open but rarely finds craneflies or moths in his room in the morning. By contrast, they were commonplace when he was a boy. \u201cOur generation is presiding over an ecological apocalypse and we\u2019ve somehow or other normalised it,\u201d he later said.</p> <p>Certainly, the statistics are grim. Native ladybird populations are crashing; three quarters of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/feb/16/urban-butterfly-declines-69-compared-to-45-drop-countryside\" title=\"\">butterfly species</a> \u2013 such as the painted lady and the Glanville fritillary \u2013 have dropped significantly in numbers; while bees, of which there are more than 250 species in the UK, are also suffering major plunges in populations, with great yellow bumblebees, solitary potter flower bees and other species declining steeply in recent years. Other threatened insects include the New Forest cicada, the tansy beetle and the oil beetle.</p> <p>As for moths, some of the most beautiful visitors to our homes and gardens, the picture is particularly alarming. Apart from the tiger moth, which was once widespread in the UK, the V-moth (<em>Marcaria wauaria</em>) recorded a 99% fall in numbers between 1968 and 2007 and is now threatened with extinction, a fate that has already befallen the orange upperwing, the bordered gothic and the Brighton wainscot in recent years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"90367754cf16532cf93dd6340b05944c5a16bb59\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/90367754cf16532cf93dd6340b05944c5a16bb59/0_161_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A great yellow bumblebee.

And it is a decline that could have crucial consequences. Our creepy crawlies may have unsettling looks but they lie at the foot of a wildlife food chain that makes them vitally important to the makeup and nature of the countryside. They are \u201cthe little things that run the world\u201d according to the distinguished Harvard biologist Edward O Wilson, who once observed: \u201cIf all humankind were to disappear, the world would regenerate back to the rich state of equilibrium that existed 10,000 years ago. If insects were to vanish, the environment would collapse into chaos.\u201d</p> <p>The best illustration of the ecological importance of insects is provided by our birdlife. Without insects, hundred of species face starvation and some ornithologists believe this lack of food is already causing serious declines in bird numbers, a point stressed by the naturalist and wildlife author Michael McCarthy. \u201cBritain\u2019s farmland birds have more than halved in number since 1970,\u201d he points out. \u201cSome declines have been catastrophic: the spotted flycatcher, a specialist predator of aerial insects, has both declined by more than 95%, while the red-backed shrike, which feeds on big beetles, became extinct in Britain in the 1990s.\u201d</p> <p>Further confirmation of the link between insect and bird numbers was provided last week with the publication of a <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ibi.12612\" title=\"\">study by Aberdeen University researchers</a> which showed that the plunge in numbers of cuckoos in some areas of England was closely linked to declines in tiger moth caterpillars on which cuckoos feed.</p> <p>\u201cThere is now a lot of correlational evidence to show that when certain insects do badly, very often the birds that feed on them get into trouble as well,\u201d said David Gibbon, of the RSPB.</p> <p>However, insects also play invaluable roles in other parts of the environment \u2013 for example as pollinators of our orchards and fruit fields. And again, scientists are worried. \u201cPeople think that it is just bees that pollinate orchards, but there are huge numbers of flies that also pollinate \u2013 and they are all also threatened,\u201d said Leather.</p> <p>In addition, flies, beetles and wasps are predators and decomposers who control pests and who generally clean up the countryside. \u201cJust think of the work of the dung beetle,\u201d added Leather. \u201cIf they go, the land would be covered with the excrement of cows, sheep and other animals.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"548cf8600e51c0559b4cfae1de662cc6554e9309\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/548cf8600e51c0559b4cfae1de662cc6554e9309/0_259_3888_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The tansy beetle, which is \u2018nationally rare\u2019, is the subject of a major conservation programme in Yorkshire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The tansy beetle, which is \u2018nationally rare\u2019, is the subject of a major conservation programme in Yorkshire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But perhaps the most alarming indication of the ecological apocalypse we face was provided a few months ago by researchers who published a startling paper in the journal <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/\" title=\"\"><em>Plos One</em></a>. Their work was based on the efforts of dozens of amateur entomologists in Germany who began employing strictly standardised ways of collecting insects in 1989. They used special tents called malaise traps to capture thousands of samples of insects in flight over dozens of different nature reserves.</p> <p>Then the weight of the insects caught in each sample was measured and analysed \u2013 revealing a remarkable pattern. The annual average weight of insects found in the traps fell by 76% over the 27-year period of their research. Most alarming, however, was the discovery that the decrease was even higher \u2013 82% \u2013 in summer, a time when insect numbers should reach their peak.</p> <p>Such figures give strong numerical support to the veracity of anecdotes about splattered car windscreens and moth-plastered patio windows becoming a thing of the past. Equally stark is the fact that although meteorological patterns fluctuated to some degree during the years of the study, it was clear that weather was not the cause of the declines.</p> <p>But perhaps the most alarming aspect of the research was the realisation that these grim drops in insect numbers were occurring in nature reserves \u2013 in other words, in areas where the landscape was highly protected and should be the most friendly of habitats for insects. Conditions elsewhere were likely to be a lot worse, the scientists warned.</p> <p>\u201cInsects make up about two-thirds of all life on Earth [but] there has been some kind of horrific decline,\u201d Professor Dave Goulson of Sussex University, said at the time. \u201cWe appear to be making vast tracts of land inhospitable to most forms of life, and are currently on course for ecological armageddon. If we lose the insects, then everything is going to&#xa0;collapse.\u201d</p> <p>The fact that insect biomass has been declining at a steady rate for almost three decades strongly suggests some profound influences must be at work. Most entomologists believe habitat change lies at the heart of the problem. \u201cThere have been massive alterations to the way we use the land and it is hard not to believe these are closely involved in what we are seeing,\u201d said Leather.</p> <p>As he points out, intensively farmed wheat and cornfields support virtually no insect life, and this means that as intensive agriculture spreads there are fewer and fewer islands of natural habitat left to support them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"107d2a581e42022d1a246103b638bebb751d08f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/107d2a581e42022d1a246103b638bebb751d08f3/0_282_5158_3096/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A garden tiger moth caterpillar. Changes in habitat caused by intensive farming have been blamed for the decline of insect populations.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A garden tiger moth caterpillar. Changes in habitat caused by intensive farming have been blamed for the decline of insect populations.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: H Lansdown/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And then there is the issue of urban spread. Housing schemes continue to encroach on our woods and heaths so that streets and buildings generate light pollution that leads nocturnal insects astray and interrupts their mating. \u201cThat is the reason we see most changes to insect life in south-east England, for that is where we see the greatest spread of cities and towns,\u201d said Leather.</p> <p>In addition to habitat changes, there are the dangers posed by pesticides, in particular neonicotinoid pesticides, which have already been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/27/eu-agrees-total-ban-on-bee-harming-pesticides\" title=\"\">blamed for recent crashes in bee populations</a>. These chemicals are water soluble and so leach out of fields after they are applied to crops.</p> <p>According to research quoted in the journal <em>Science</em> last year, these pesticides have since been found in high concentrations in nectar and pollen in wildflowers near treated fields. Though still not at levels sufficiently high to kill insects directly, they do affect their abilities to navigate and communicate.</p> <p>In the face of this mixture of ecological woes, it is perhaps not surprising that insects in Britain are faring so badly. Whether or not they face an ecological apocalypse is a different matter, for not every expert shares a sense of doom. Professor Helen Roy of the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, for example, sees cause for hope. She told the <em>Observer</em> that there were too many success stories \u2013 tales of insects that were recovering in numbers and thriving \u2013 to feel a sense of despair. \u201cObviously, many species are suffering, but I am an optimist and I just don\u2019t think it is right to call this an apocalypse,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Roy pointed to explosions in the number of ladybirds and painted lady butterflies that have occurred in the past as evidence. \u201cThere are huge variations in numbers of a particular insect species in a year and huge variation in the places you see them.\u201d She also pointed to one study of pollinators that showed while 32% became less widespread between 1980 and 2014, 16% became more widespread. \u201cIt is not all doom and gloom,\u201d Roy added.</p> <p>This view was supported by David Gibbons of the RSPB who agreed that not every investigation about insect numbers revealed a tale of irrevocable decline \u2013 though he added that he still believed the overall picture was worrying. \u201cIt is hard not to see a link between some of the bird number declines and drops in insect populations we are experiencing. There are very close correlations in many cases. But proving there is a causative link \u2013 in establishing the one effect is leading to the other \u2013 is much more difficult.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We appear to be making tracts of land inhospitable to most forms of life. If we lose insects, it all collapses</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>An illustration of the problem is provided by one of the few cases where a causative link between insect loss and bird-number declines has been established: the grey partridge, Gibbons said. \u201cDuring the 70s and 80s, pesticides were killing off plants on which sawflies and other insects fed. Grey partridge chicks feed&#xa0;on these insects and so this process led to a decline in their numbers \u2013 and that has since become dramatic.\u201d In fact, the grey partridge\u2019s drop in numbers has brought its population to less than 5% of its figure last century.</p> <p>The crucial point is that researchers were able to show that these twin declines were connnected by manipulating herbicide levels in places where chicks were being reared. When herbicide levels went up, insect levels went down and so did bird numbers. \u201cThat manipulation provided the causative link,\u201d said Gibbons. \u201cIt was possible to change insect numbers and so see the impact. However, such research is difficult to carry out and is very rare.\u201d</p> <p>And of course, threats to our birdlife are only one aspect of the dangers posed by losses of insects in the UK. As entomologists point out, they also keep our soil fertile, degrade waste, pollinate our orchards and control pests such as the aphid.</p> <p>\u201cWe cannot afford to lose them and that\u2019s what makes this issue so urgent and so important,\u201d Leather concluded. \u201cThat\u2019s worth keeping in mind as the summer evenings begin \u2013 and we see hardly any insects.\u201d</p> <h2>Ladybirds<br></h2> <p>Many of Britain\u2019s native species of ladybirds are suffering serious declines in numbers, thanks to the arrival of the&#xa0;harlequin ladybird. It has been declared the UK\u2019s fastest invading species, after reaching almost every corner of the country in just a decade. It preys on native ladybirds and is believed to have caused the decline of&#xa0;at least seven species, including the popular two-spot ladybird, which \u2013 when last assessed in 2012 \u2013 had slumped by 44% in numbers.</p> <h2>Moths<br></h2> <p>More than 2,500 moth species have been recorded in Great Britain, of which around 900 are called larger moths. In the report The State of Britain\u2019s Larger Moths 2013, it was revealed that larger moths had declined by 28% between 1968 and 2007. This was most noticeable in southern Britain where there was a 40% decline. By contrast, numbers showed no significant change in northern Britain, where disappearing species are balanced by moths spreading north because of climate change.</p> <h2>Bees<br></h2> <p>Seventy of the 100 crop species that provide 90% of food worldwide are pollinated by bees. In the UK, there are more than 250 species of bee: 25&#xa0;species of bumble bee, 224 species of solitary bee and one honey bee species. According to a government report in 2014, figures there has been an overall decline in wild and honey bees over the past 50 years. The figures also revealed evidence that there has been parallel declines in the plants that rely on them for pollination.</p> <h2>Butterflies<br></h2> <p>The State of the UK\u2019s Butterflies report \u2013 produced in 2015 by Butterfly Conservation \u2013 provided further evidence of \u201cthe serious, long-term and ongoing decline of UK butterflies\u201d. Overall, 76% of the UK\u2019s resident and regular migrant butterfly species had declined in either abundance or occurrence (or both) over the past four decades, it was found. \u201cThis is of great concern not just for butterflies but for other wildlife species and the overall state of the environment,\u201d the report noted.</p> <h2>Beetles<br></h2> <p>These insects eat large volumes of slugs and aphids and large numbers of weed seeds, thus helping to stop fields being overrun by unwanted plants and pests. However, a study, published in the Journal of Applied Ecology in 2012 - which looked at 68 beetle species at 11 locations around the British Isles over 15 years - found that three-quarters of those examined had declined in number over the periodOf these, half had fallen at rate equivalent to 30% per decade.</p>", "wordcount": "2388"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "artanddesign/2019/sep/17/the-best-visual-art-of-the-21st-century", "type": "article", "sectionId": "artanddesign", "sectionName": "Art and design", "webPublicationDate": "2019-09-17T05:00:32Z", "webTitle": "The best art of the 21st century", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/sep/17/the-best-visual-art-of-the-21st-century", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2019/sep/17/the-best-visual-art-of-the-21st-century", "fields": {"byline": "Adrian Searle, Jonathan Jones, Sean O\u2019Hagan and Hettie Judah", "body": "<h2>25<strong> Tacita Dean<br></strong>Antigone (2018)</h2> <p>Almost an hour long, Tacita Dean\u2019s film is a summation of her work to date.

He would be very good at staging a Pink Floyd reunion. But in fact he is a very thoughtful artist, fascinated by colour, light and the fragile state of nature.

A pair of twins play concertina and cello in different rooms \u2013 all the musicians were audible to one another through headphones. There are two pianists, a guitarist, drums. The Visitors is a live performance, each musician visible on a different screen. Outside, there is a party on the porch, where the house\u2019s current occupants take in the early evening. Captured in real time, one evening at sunset, the music builds and dies and builds again. The song repeats and develops, reaches false crescendos and plateaus. Ragnar, in the bath, is nearly submerged in soap bubbles as he sings, \u201cOnce again I\u2019m falling into my feminine ways.\u201d \u201cThere are stars exploding around you / And there is nothing / Nothing you can do,\u201d goes another refrain, in this idyllic crumbling retreat. You get sucked in.</p> <p>You feel like a guest yourself in this marvellous, immersive multiscreen film. The more often I see it, the more I come to inhabit its rooms. Why is it so compelling and, with its repetitions, so watchable multiple times? The fragility of friendship and love, communality and miscommunication all have a part here. </p> <p>The title of the work is taken from Abba\u2019s final album, when the band were falling apart. The film\u2019s absurdities and longeurs, the light, and the concentration of all the performers and the repetition of the song is utterly compelling and hypnotic. Youthfulness and idealism feel like a fading dream in the evening\u2019s light. The Visitors is a kind of extended farewell to romanticism, to which Ragnar is both drawn and deeply suspicious of. Writing this, I want to see The Visitors again, immediately. <strong>AS<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/jun/28/ragnar-kjartansson-interview-iceland-barbican-the-visitors\">Read more here</a>.</p>", "wordcount": "2667"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}, {"id": "lifeandstyle/2018/mar/31/the-best-climbers-for-shade-gardening-plants", "type": "article", "sectionId": "lifeandstyle", "sectionName": "Life and style", "webPublicationDate": "2018-03-31T10:00:10Z", "webTitle": "The best climbers for shade | Alys Fowler", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/31/the-best-climbers-for-shade-gardening-plants", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/31/the-best-climbers-for-shade-gardening-plants", "fields": {"byline": "Alys Fowler", "body": "<p>I have been washing up looking out on a&#xa0;wooden fence for over 10 years.

If it is not dealt with in a way that considers the interest of these three sectors, immigration will continue to poison politics everywhere.<br><strong>Colin Hines</strong><br>East Twickenham<br></p> <h2>Cannabis hypocrisy<br></h2> <p>The Home Office has finally seen sense and shown compassion in allowing Billy Caldwell to be treated with medicinal cannabis (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/16/billy-caldwells-mother-hopeful-of-cannabis-medicine-licence\" title=\"\">Family wins right to treat son\u2019s severe epilepsy with cannabis oil</a>\u201d, News). However, in treating the decision as \u201cexceptional\u201d, the home secretary, Sajid Javid, highlights the government\u2019s double standards when it comes to medicinal cannabis. According to the UN\u2019s international narcotics control board, the UK accounted for 44.9% of the world\u2019s production and 70% of exports in 2016. It is hypocritical for the country to reap the commercial but not the medicinal rewards of medical cannabis. <br><strong>Neil Macehiter</strong><br>Cambridge<br></p> <h2>You can\u2019t measure the mind<br></h2> <p>How can \u201cintelligent\u201d people believe in the validity of IQ tests (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/17/dumbing-down-or-need-better--smarter-measure\" title=\"\">If we were really smart, we\u2019d get over our fixation on the IQ test</a>\u201d, Comment)? Presumably because they have, or believe they have, high scores themselves, as \u201cmeasured\u201d by such tests.</p> <p>But how can something as complex and multifaceted as intelligent thought and action be captured in a single \u201cmeasure\u201d? It can\u2019t. Intelligent thought and action can only be judged, albeit imperfectly \u2013 they cannot be subject to a metric. <br><strong>Colin Richards</strong><br>Spark Bridge, Cumbria<br></p> <h2>Favouring the few<br></h2> <p>I was interested to read Charlie Cooper\u2019s letter suggesting that Grenfell reflected the divisions in society between the \u201cdeserving\u201d and \u201cundeserving\u201d poor (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/17/dementia-johns-campaign-fight-for-dignity\" title=\"\">Putting Grenfell in context</a>\u201d, letters). I believe that the issue is wider than that and reflects more the long-term issue of deregulation to favour a few at the expense not only of the poor but the vast majority of the population.</p> <p>Deregulation may have been a key feature of Thatcher\u2019s government but it was carried on, to their shame, by Blair and Brown. It takes many forms, from the removal or watering down of legislation and standards, the withdrawal of funding from regulators, pressure on regulators not to enforce and a move away from expert to less qualified regulators. If all that fails, organisations are given the chance to employ their own regulators/auditors, who have a clear conflict of interest. The effects of such policies may not be noticed for some time but eventually lead to a catastrophe, be it the banking crisis or the various contributory failings at Grenfell.</p> <p>There is also a link to Brexit. One might wonder why so much money was put into the Leave campaign. It was not because employers were worried about immigration or wanted the public to be able to buy straight bananas or curved cucumbers \u2013 it was in an attempt to remove legislation that prevents their short-term gain at the expense of employees, suppliers, consumers and the public.<br><br><strong>Nigel Long</strong><br><br>Keynsham, Bristol<br></p> <h2>Diversity debate deepens<br></h2> <p>Kenan Malik makes some excellent and long overdue comments about the diversity versus equality debate stimulated by Lionel Shriver\u2019s recent criticism of Penguin Random House\u2019s pledge to make its company more reflective of society (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/17/we-are-confusing-diversity-and-equality-which-is-our-priority\" title=\"\">We\u2019re now confusing diversity and equality. Which is our priority</a>?\u201d Comment).</p> <p>I agree that diversity does not necessarily ensure equality and that the most marginalised have often been forgotten, the best example of this being the virtual abandonment of the white working class. Instead of seeking the unattainable goal of absolute equality or diversity, we should be striving for equality of opportunity. A black, working-class teenager should have an equal chance of getting into Oxbridge as a white, middle-class applicant; a white, middle-class applicant should have the same chance of getting into a football academy as a black, working-class kid. The best way to ensure this is through a rigorous education system.<br><strong>Stan Labovitch</strong><br>Windsor<br></p> <h2>Of birds and bees<br></h2> <p>It is shocking to see how the insect life in our garden has disappeared (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/17/where-have-insects-gone-climate-change-population-decline\" title=\"\">Where have all our insects gone?</a>\u201d, Special report). Normally, the lawn is covered with bees enjoying the clover flowers, but this year there are hardly any or on the apple trees. There are no butterflies on the nectar plants either. Our garden was a haven for wildlife as we don\u2019t use chemical sprays. However, I notice when the 40-acre field next to us is sprayed the bees in our garden seem to disappear.</p> <p>City dwellers will probably never notice the lack of insects in the concrete canyons, but it will affect us all when we suddenly wake up and discover that we have no insects or birds any more.<br><strong>Sheena Howarth</strong><br>Worcester<br></p> <h2>Kitty\u2019s legacy<br></h2> <p>It is fitting that a non-commercial launderette opening in a poor area of Liverpool should be named after Kitty Wilkinson, who opened the country\u2019s first public washhouse during a cholera epidemic in the 1830s (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/16/kitty-wilkinson-first-public-washhouse-liverpool-launderette\" title=\"\">Soap suds and films honour the legacy of the Saint of the Slums</a>\u201d, Notebook). Contrast this with what was happening at the same time in Torquay, then the wealthiest town outside London, when William Kitson, the \u201cMaker of Torquay\u201d, continuously refused to have a public washhouse built on the grounds of unnecessary expense. It was perhaps not a coincidence that cholera struck the town in 1832, while another outbreak in 1849 claimed 66 lives in six weeks, most victims coming from the slums rather from the grand villas, crescents and terraces so beloved of Mr Kitson.<br><br></p> <p><strong>Jack Critchlow</strong><br><br>Torquay, Devon<br></p> <h2>Noli me tangere<br></h2> <p>\u201cUndisturbed forest is incredibly rare,\u201d said Dr Simon Willcock (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2018/jun/17/the-secret-rainforest-hidden-at-the-heart-of-an-african-volcano-in-pictures\" title=\"\">The secret rainforest hidden at the heart of an African volcano</a>\u201d, Focus).

The half-life of neonicotinoids is estimated somewhere between 34 days and three years as they break down in the soil; it is not only flying insects that are affected during that time, but bacteria, amoebae, worms and insects in the soil, too. Even when the levels of toxicity are too low to kill soil fauna, studies have shown that they impair earthworms\u2019 ability to tunnel.

And as summer approaches, my thoughts turn greedily to herbs. But let\u2019s be adventurous here: a single plant of something new can radically change your cooking, offering new pairings and flavours. So it\u2019s time to think beyond parsley, basil and rosemary. I have another agenda for wanting more herbs in your life: I\u2019ve become president of the <a href=\"http://www.herbsociety.org.uk/\">Herb Society</a>, founded by the magnificent Hilda Leyel in 1927, who believed passionately that herbs increased our health and wellbeing.</p> <p>If I wish anything for you this growing season it\u2019s that you sow from seed, because the rarer stuff is often not available as plants at garden centres, where there\u2019s limited space. Seeds take up no room and can be sent anywhere. Plus, there\u2019s the satisfaction of seeing through the whole life cycle with nurture and love.</p> <p>Here are 10 herbs to expand your range: all, I promise, will bring joy to you, your garden and the bees.</p> <h2><strong>1 Sweet bergamot, Monarda didyma </strong></h2> <p>Also known as bee balm or oswego tea, this is a North American prairie herb. It tastes of bergamot, with a hint of mint and thyme. If you like Earl Grey tea, you\u2019d enjoy this as a great infusion and it\u2019s a beautiful, bee-friendly addition to the garden.

The leaves grow hand-sized, meaning a single leaf fits perfectly in a sandwich, with a flavour similar to sweet basil but slightly stronger. Grow in a pot, somewhere sheltered and warm; slugs love the large leaves when young, so mollycoddle it. I\u2019d even consider growing inside on a windowsill until July. Buy from <a href=\"https://www.seedsofitaly.com/\">seedsofitaly.com</a>.</p> <h2><strong>3 Summer savory, Satureja hortensis</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3adb4376200c74283f80f8fba94a948d400b17a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3adb4376200c74283f80f8fba94a948d400b17a1/0_477_3840_4949/776.jpg\" alt=\"Summer savory\" width=\"776\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">If you use a lot of thyme, try summer savory.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If you use a lot of thyme in cooking, then you\u2019ll love the tender tips of summer savory. This is the herb to pair with beans, with its sweet, spicy, peppery notes and pungent aroma. Or use under the skin of a roast chicken, in pork dishes and with cabbage. It is easy to dry for winter. It grows best in full sun, in free-draining soil, and is very happy in a pot. It is not frost hardy. Buy from <a href=\"https://www.sarahraven.com/veg_fruit/seeds/herb_seeds\">sarahraven.com</a>.</p> <h2><strong>4 Mitsuba, Japanese wild parsley</strong> </h2> <p>Somewhere between parsley and celery, and with a hint of sorrel and coriander, this is a subtle herb. Use the sprouts in salads and the leaves much like parsley. If your garden is shady, this is the one for you. Grow it in the sun and it will taste bitter. Buy from <a href=\"https://www.kingsseeds.com/\">kingsseeds.com</a> or <a href=\"https://www.chilternseeds.co.uk/\">chilternseeds.co.uk</a>.</p> <h2><strong>5 Tulsi, Ocimum tenuiflorum</strong> </h2> <p>Holy basil makes for a wonderful tea and smells heavenly of peppermint, cloves, liquorice and lemons.

And yet Austin\u2019s blooms, known as English roses, burst on to the scene only in the 1960s. Over many decades, he learned to cross the beauty and fragrance of the genuinely old rose species \u2013 the musks and the gallicas \u2013 with the disease-resistance and repeat flowering of roses bred in the modern age.</p> <p>At first, nurseries would not sell them \u2013 they were seen as old-fashioned \u2013 but Austin persisted, breeding more than 200 new varieties in the past few decades. In the process, he slowly but surely changed horticulture\u2019s obsession with the stiff, scentless formality of the hybrid tea rose, embracing instead the softer, scented pastel shades that are now his signature style.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"8d08f161c42df384551a3fc53091e95eebc70ffb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d08f161c42df384551a3fc53091e95eebc70ffb/0_724_3840_3226/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Austin in his rose garden.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"840\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Austin in his rose garden.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lynn Keddie/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Austin has been less committed to his own back garden, however. For years, the private plot behind his Queen Anne house at the heart of his rose nursery in Shropshire was the domain of his wife, Pat, a sculptor who liked to let nature take charge.

In this later role as a consulting engineer John was a dangerous opponent for the secretive nuclear establishment because his inside knowledge gave him the ability to ask difficult questions and expose weaknesses. He was never afraid to speak truth to power, although it took courage to take on such a powerful industry.</p> <p>Despite his chosen role as an outsider, John\u2019s abilities meant he had an astonishing list of clients ranging from the Russian Federation, the British government, the <a href=\"https://www.iaea.org/\" title=\"\">International Atomic Energy Agency</a> (IAEA) and Greenpeace International. He was invited by the IAEA to China, North Korea and Iran, and by others to the US and Japan, to give advice on their nuclear programmes and the risks they posed.</p> <p>John was still the leading independent analyst of safety and security in the nuclear industry at the time of his death, aged 75, from a heart attack. He was working on a report pressing for the permanent closure of <a href=\"https://www.edfenergy.com/energy/power-stations/hunterston-b\" title=\"\">Hunterston B</a> nuclear plant in north Ayrshire, currently offline while cracks in the graphite bricks are investigated.</p> <p>While John often gave the impression that he had just stepped off the floor of an engineering works and was too busy to talk, he was in fact generous with his time and patient enough to explain a point of nuclear physics to an inquiring reporter.</p> <p>He insisted on accuracy. As a result journalists who were faced with a secretive industry frequently turned to him to see if a possible story was credible, and for background information. Once I asked him how he knew about a serious problem with refuelling Britain\u2019s fleet of advanced gas-cooled reactors, including Hunterston B, and he replied it was because he had helped design them.</p> <p>He rarely talked about his achievements, but he was proud of his role in 2001 in overseeing nuclear safety for the successful raising of the Russian nuclear-powered K-141 submarine, the Kursk, which had sunk a year earlier with the loss of all 118 crew. He was the main nuclear adviser to the Dutch salvage company <a href=\"https://www.mammoet.com/\" title=\"\">Mammoet-Smit</a> and the Russian Federation, for which the Russians gave him a medal.</p> <p>But it was his detailed reports for governments, MPs and campaigning organisations that had the most influence. They were always written in the same easy to understand but precise style and detail. Though many of the reports made uncomfortable reading for governments and the industry, nobody ever suggested his facts or interpretation were wrong, even though they often tried to ignore them. Some of his latest reports on the danger of terrorism to nuclear installations in Britain and elsewhere have been kept secret to avoid revealing the industry\u2019s weakest points.</p> <p>His immense knowledge stemmed from working in the 1960s and 70s as a senior research fellow with the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-atomic-energy-authority\" title=\"\">UK Atomic Energy Authority</a> while a member of the department of mechanical engineering at Brunel University in west London. At the time the UKAEA was responsible for Britain\u2019s intertwined civil and military nuclear programmes and only employed the brightest and best brains. Much of his early work is still classified as secret.</p> <p>In the late 60s John worked for a time at Windscale (now Sellafield), where plutonium for Britain\u2019s nuclear weapons programme was produced and then transferred to the US in the early 70s as part of the 1958 US/UK Nuclear Cooperation Agreement. A curious attempt by the US military to get him to serve in Vietnam led John to take a sudden fishing holiday in Canada before returning directly to the UK and resuming work at Brunel University and the UKAEA.</p> <p>John\u2019s background as the son of a Fleet Street printer, Henry Large, and his wife, Rose (nee Hampshire), the landlady of the Neptune pub in Bermondsey, gave him a quick wit and ability to get to the point. His direct approach made a big impact in many court appearances as an expert witness, before committees of MPs, and in television studios.</p> <p>He was born in Woking, Surrey, but grew up in London, where he went to Wilson\u2019s grammar school in Peckham, and spent a year at Camberwell School of Art, before studying engineering at Imperial College. He was appointed a research assistant at Brunel in 1968, promoted to lecturer in 1971, and remained on the staff there until 1986.</p> <p>He began the second phase of his career that year when he set up Large &amp; Associates, consultant engineers that at one time employed up to 40 people. It was when things went wrong at nuclear power plants that John found himself in greatest demand. His first technical assessment of the Fukushima accident in Japan in 2011 confirmed a triple reactor meltdown within two weeks, well before it was officially acknowledged.</p> <p>As well as his work, he applied his skills to restoring the 18th-century Robert Adam home he shared with his partner, Jenny Sherrell (known to everyone, including John, as AP, because she was from Alexandra Palace). This was in Ha-Ha Road overlooking the military barracks in Woolwich, an address that delighted him. There he kept bees and over 40 years took a leading role in the running of <a href=\"http://www.largeassociates.com/cz1000/cz1000.htm\" title=\"\">Oxleas Wood Apiary</a>, located at Shooters Hill, a remnant of old London countryside. For many years he taught with great enthusiasm a 10-week summer course for aspiring beekeepers.</p> <p>He is survived by Jenny, his daughter, Joanna, from an earlier relationship, and his brother, Bob.</p> <p>\u2022 John Henry Large, consulting engineer, born 4 May 1943; died 3 November 2018</p>", "wordcount": "954"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "lifeandstyle/2018/may/26/how-to-grow-the-best-runner-beans", "type": "article", "sectionId": "lifeandstyle", "sectionName": "Life and style", "webPublicationDate": "2018-05-26T10:00:53Z", "webTitle": "How to grow the best runner beans | Alys Fowler", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/26/how-to-grow-the-best-runner-beans", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/26/how-to-grow-the-best-runner-beans", "fields": {"byline": "Alys Fowler", "body": "<p>Runner beans like it rich and deep.

The Greens championed the hay meadows to protect some of Oslo\u2019s most vulnerable species at a time when the city\u2019s human population was increasing more rapidly than that of almost any other European capital.</p> <p>\u201cWe know that we need to protect and restore biodiversity even as we build new homes. In a city that is growing fast, it\u2019s also important to make it nice to live. That means good quality green areas,\u201d said vice-mayor Lan Marie Nguyen Berg from the Green party. \u201cWe\u2019d like to transfer the knowledge that we have to other cities.\u201d</p> <p>For centuries, meadows were used here and in many other countries to grow winter fodder for cattle on nutrient-poor land that was unsuitable for continuous large-scale grazing. The annual cycle of cutting and growing nurtured an abundance of insects, plants, fungi, birds, small mammals and wild grazers such as deer on these sunny grasslands.</p> <p>But they have declined in recent decades due to the expansion of industrial farming and land use for buildings. Botanists say there are almost no meadows left in nearby Denmark. Britain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/18/losing-97-percent-britain-wildflower-meadows-matters-butterfly\" title=\"\">has also witnessed a decline</a>. With 24% of Oslo\u2019s 4,000 red-listed species depending on meadows, the government decided to recreate the habitat in a dozen pilot plots.</p> <p>This number is set to grow. The Norwegian council for biodiversity (Sabima) has lobbied the government to provide a budget for farmers to maintain meadows and other ecologically important areas. There are now 32 of these biodiversity hotspots. Over the next decade, they aim for 100.</p> <p>\u201cOslo can be considered a model because we know what\u2019s there and how to protect it,\u201d biologist and campaigner Anna Blix said during a rainy walk through one of the latest additions in T\u00f8yen Park. \u201cWe don\u2019t have huge endangered mammals in meadows, but there are many important plants and insects that are at risk.\u201d</p> <p>As well as the economic benefits that come from pollinators, she said a strong natural habitat was likely to be more resilient to storms and rising temperatures. \u201cIt is increasingly recognised that biodiversity is crucial for action against climate change.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c1f5300e8b866ed1ee90d0435ec6539ef167efd5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1f5300e8b866ed1ee90d0435ec6539ef167efd5/0_282_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mowing exercise at a meadow with high biodiversity in the northern part of Oslo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mowing exercise at a meadow with high biodiversity in the northern part of Oslo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Norway Natural History Museum</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The cost is low because some of the meadow grasses are \u201cweeds\u201d that would grow by themselves on untended land. But there is also a technical side of the project that involves the selection of appropriately poor soil and the cultivation in nurseries of the right species to maximise ecological richness so that bees and other pollinators can thrive for much of the year.</p> <p>Bjureke said the campaign made economic sense \u2013 and not just because of the bees. She cited the case of mountain arnica, which is used in the production of anti-inflammatory creams. This ground-hugging yellow daisy depends on the regular scything of longer grass once a year so it can get sufficient light. But with this custom in decline over recent decades, the once common flower is now on the nation\u2019s red list for endangered species, leaving the cream business dominated by German pharmaceutical companies that buy daisies from Romania.</p> <p>Thanks to the improved collaboration between city hall, scientists and NGOs, she hopes Oslo can arrest the decline. \u201cMore and more people are asking how they can get involved and they are getting younger and younger. For me, the most positive trend is that more students are now interested in field biology than lab studies of DNA.\u201d</p> <p>Amateur biologists are now helping scientists with a nationwide biodiversity census that aims not just to count and locate species, but to highlight their value.</p> <p>There is a long way to go. Insect corridors help to raise awareness in cities but they cannot solve the bigger problems in the countryside caused by pesticides and industrial farming. Those who want to protect Oslo\u2019s ecological wealth know it is more important to prevent development encroaching on the forest and to scale down the nation\u2019s dependence on fossil fuels. Compared to the areas of robot-mowed grass in the city\u2019s parks, the urban meadows are tiny but their value is not just a matter of size or money, according to Bjureke.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I go to the meadows, I feel complete. I see the activity and complexity of nature, the composition of small and big species. It\u2019s the best way to relieve stress.

My commitment hasn\u2019t wavered, but the questions surrounding what is and isn\u2019t vegan continue to plague me on a weekly (and sometimes daily) basis. While many assume veganism is strictly about refusing to use animal products, for most vegans it is also about living a life that excludes all forms of animal exploitation. And with mainstream veganism firmly on the rise, the questions keep coming as we learn more about the agricultural price-tags of our choices. Of course, each new discovery is greeted with delight by many non-vegans, who revel in the notion that we\u2019ve been caught out. There is now even a website <a href=\"http://almondsarenotvegan.com/\" title=\"\">dedicated to almonds not being vegan</a> (more on this later).</p> <p>As recently as last week, my \u201cnearly vegan\u201d mother passed on a concerned message from a close friend who felt it imperative that I know almonds (yep, them again) are emphatically not vegan. Cease the almond consumption immediately (that is, if they come from California). Oh, and don\u2019t forget avocados too \u2013 particularly if they\u2019re of the Mexican variety. Add dates to the list while you\u2019re at it \u2026 and what\u2019s the deal with figs again?</p> <p>It\u2019s not just non-vegans who want to catch us out. My brief foray into vegan chatrooms quickly made it clear that there was a competitive side to the vegan community. The dos and don\u2019ts quickly morphed into intense question marks over who was living their best vegan life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"148a75a694f99d58c0f97457f092746a2aa727e5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/148a75a694f99d58c0f97457f092746a2aa727e5/0_329_5855_3513/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Almonds\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Almonds may not be truly vegan food.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mumemories/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If some hapless newbie admitted they accidentally consumed something that contained the smallest amount of dairy they would be hauled over the hot coals into plant-based purgatory. (Even Peta fell foul of this tendency when it tweeted that <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/food-news/news/a58737/are-oreos-vegan/\" title=\"\">Oreo</a><a href=\"https://www.delish.com/food-news/news/a58737/are-oreos-vegan/\" title=\"\"> biscuits are</a><a href=\"https://www.delish.com/food-news/news/a58737/are-oreos-vegan/\" title=\"\"> vegan, </a>sparking a row over whether they can contain traces of milk.) It wasn\u2019t the best introduction to the lifestyle, and so I left. Not veganism, the chat room.</p> <p>As a result, perhaps the biggest question remained unanswered: is there such thing as the perfect vegan? Or do we need to stop thinking about it in absolutes? \u201cNobody can be a perfect vegan, as we live in a very non-vegan world,\u201d says the YouTube sensation Madeleine Olivia. \u201cThere are many things that are beyond our control. I don\u2019t eat or buy animal products; however, I will purchase secondhand wool and eat foods that say \u2018may contain\u2019 on the label. I think it\u2019s totally up to the individual to decide on their own version of veganism and to not be strict with themselves to the point of it becoming stressful.\u201d She says that what matters most with veganism is \u201cdoing your best to avoid animal products and animal cruelty\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Every potato, every stick of celery, every cup of rice and every carrot has a blood trail leading from field to plate</p> <footer> <cite>Ward M Clark</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The reason some vegans have taken avocados, almonds and even broccoli off the table is a clip from the BBC panel show QI, which highlighted one of the practices used in their production: migratory beekeeping. It\u2019s an uncomfortable reality that much of what we consume is reliant on the way in which our crops are pollinated, with some commercial beekeepers admitting their biggest challenge is simply keeping the bees alive. Likewise, organic fruit and vegetables could be deemed not vegan, particularly if grown using animal-origin fertilisers. How, then, can one determine if anything is truly 100% vegan?</p> <p>Ward M Clark, the author of Misplaced Compassion: the Animal Rights Movement Exposed, wrote in an online essay that \u201cevery potato, every stick of celery, every cup of rice, and every carrot has a blood trail leading from field to plate\u201d.</p> <p>In the same piece, he claimed that even soybean production (at least in the US) left untold death in its wake: \u201cPheasants and rabbits are routinely killed in planting and harvesting, and rodents are killed by the thousands using traps and pesticides at every step, production, storage and transportation.\u201d</p> <p>Likewise, Prof Andrew Smith, the author of A Critique of the Moral Defense of Vegetarianism and a dedicated vegan himself, would probably concur that it is impossible to be 100% vegan, not least because plants get their nutrients from the soil, which is partly composed of decayed animal remains. The truth is, most of us are happy to accept veganism with its multitude of imperfections, knowing that as the paradigm slowly shifts, so too will food production and its practices.</p> <p>Derek Sarno, the co-founder of the hugely popular Wicked Kitchen range at Tesco, has a refreshingly pragmatic approach to veganism that speaks to the message at the core of the movement. \u201cI believe in the aspiration of the word veganism,\u201d he says. \u201cI live what I would call more like \u2018compassionism\u2019, or at least I try to practise compassion when I can, as much as I can, given the tools and experiences that I have acquired. I\u2019m not perfect. I do my best and I make mistakes. It\u2019s easy for me to cook plant-centred foods; it\u2019s not so easy to tick every single box out there, so we focus on what we can change right now and work towards what we can influence in the bigger picture.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2018/nov/12/bloody-beetroot-burgers-why-would-anyone-want-them\">Bloody beetroot burgers \u2013 why would anyone want them?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some might call my own style akin to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/thematic/sufficientarianism/v-1\" title=\"\">sufficientarianism</a>\u201d: mine is maybe not the type of veganism that ticks every ethical box, but I take on board the complexities of living in the modern world. Veganuary is a charity set up to encourage people to try dropping animal products and its CEO, Simon Winch, says its \u201cphilosophy is that it\u2019s about doing your best, and not losing sleep over it\u201d. He says: \u201cIf you\u2019re doing what you reasonably can to not consume animal products, then eating something which turns out to have an obscure non-vegan E number in it isn\u2019t really the end of the world.\u201d</p> <p>Is it time, then, that we stopped thinking in absolutes? Is some flexibility allowed as we continue to piece together the facts surrounding our food and its origins? According to the Vegan Society, veganism is something that \u201cseeks to exclude, as far as is possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing and any other purpose\u201d.</p> <p>Unfortunately, in modern society it isn\u2019t \u201cpossible\u201d or \u201cpracticable\u201d (according to the Vegan Society) to know the history of each and every piece of fruit and veg we purchase. Maybe some leeway should be afforded, taking into account the complexities of our multifaceted modern food chain. If you\u2019re happy being a perfectly imperfect vegan like myself, and adapting as you go, knowing that you may fall short some of the time, then you\u2019ll probably find some middle ground that satisfies your drive to do less harm without it affecting your every waking moment. </p>", "wordcount": "1122"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}, {"id": "lifeandstyle/2018/apr/28/how-to-grow-mexican-bolivian-coriander", "type": "article", "sectionId": "lifeandstyle", "sectionName": "Life and style", "webPublicationDate": "2018-04-28T10:00:12Z", "webTitle": "How to grow Mexican and Bolivian coriander | Alys Fowler", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/28/how-to-grow-mexican-bolivian-coriander", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/28/how-to-grow-mexican-bolivian-coriander", "fields": {"byline": "Alys Fowler", "body": "<p>I am a big fan of coriander in the garden and in the kitchen; I love those earthy, citrussy notes that temper salt and spice so well.

It pleases us to imagine them prodding the fat rumps of our livestock, testing our grains with their clean Invisible fingernails.</p> <p>Tell us more, we say, and Martha dimples like a girl.</p> <p>There are many of them, she says. Sometimes the Invisible outnumber other visitors.</p> <p>But why do they come to market?</p> <p>For amusement, I suppose. Entertainment.</p> <p>We look each other up and down, wondering which of us is most entertaining.</p> <p>The Ingrams have called at Martha\u2019s cottage, of an evening, to pay their respects.</p> <p>Miss Ingram has such pale hands, Martha says. As if she keeps them folded away in a linen chest.</p> <p>What language do they speak?</p> <p>It is English, I presume. I seem to understand some of it. But their speech is strange. Until you are very close, it\u2019s like a noise of leaves or water.</p> <p>We cannot think why, of all of us, they would choose Martha. She is not the most educated or wise. Not even the most gullible.</p> <p>Invite us along next time they visit, says Jacob. That should sort the wheat from the goats.</p> <p>They wouldn\u2019t allow it, Martha says.</p> <p>What are you afraid of? Jacob says. Let\u2019s settle this once and for all.</p> <p>Come on Martha, we say. Let\u2019s settle this. Unless you have reason to be afraid.</p> <p>I would love to see Miss Ingram\u2019s dress, says Eliza. And her jewellery. I would love to see how she does her hair.</p> <p>Oh yes, we say. We\u2019d love to see her dress and her hair and her jewellery.</p> <p>It\u2019s out of the question, Martha keeps saying. They would never agree.</p> <p>But if there is one thing we know, it is persistence.<br></p> <p><em><strong>Freckled peas</strong></em></p> <p>The Vestry can find no regulations that apply. In the past, Martha might have been suspected of contracting with demons, but the Parliament in London has repealed the law against witchcraft. We don\u2019t know if this is because we\u2019ve progressed beyond such superstition or because all the witches have been drowned.</p> <p>Martha has never been known as a fool or a liar. Once she claimed to have seen a yellow cat the size of a two-tooth hogget at her door, but perhaps she did, and if not, anyone could make that mistake. Jacob complained that she sold him a calf that was already sick and it expired within a day, but they resolved that dispute between them. Mostly she has lived the way we all do, evenly, tidily, respecting time and season. She plants oats and beans and freckled peas on her late father\u2019s holding, keeps bees and chickens, drives her cow to the grazings. She has no husband or children bringing home a wage from the quarry, but then she has no one for whom she must buy tea and sugar. She is a hard worker, if a slow one. When she was a baby her mother, Rebecca, stumbling, as we understand, let her fall in the hearth. In the moments it took the parents to react, flames bit through the swaddling, gnawed the tender infant limbs. We found Rebecca later in the church porch, hanged dead. Martha was left with a limp and, in her breath, a hiss as of hot ashes settling. But she is not one to make excuses. She salts her own bacon, gathers her own turf and bark. She has a reputation as a pickler and preserver, putting up the greater part of her harvest and whatever she collects from woods and wastes. She\u2019s able to sell her surplus to lazier households. She is careful with her animals, keeping them clean and dry. In hard winters, she stints herself to feed them.</p> <p><em><strong>Plump and handsome</strong></em></p> <p>Martha is adamant that the Invisible are not the Tylwyth Teg, who are known to be short and ill-favoured.</p> <p>The Ingrams are as tall as we are, she points out. Taller. They\u2019re plump and handsome.</p> <p>Also the Tylwyth Teg are spiteful. They bear grudges for generations. They hide robins\u2019 eggs in shoes, crumble owl pellets into the flour.</p> <p>The Invisible, Martha says, are smiling always, and if they are not smiling they are laughing. They are generous. Once I saw Miss Ingram pick up a fallen kit and place it back with its fellows.</p> <p>But on further questioning, she admits such acts of charity are rare. Mostly the Invisible keep apart, chattering among themselves.</p> <p>How do they dress?</p> <p>It is the fashion of the city, I suppose, all bright colours and embroidery. And everything always new. Not darned or frayed or even muddy. As if every day is Easter Day.</p> <p>Do any of them resemble your father? John Protheroe the smith wants to know. Or Price Price or Mother Jenkins?</p> <p>But we hush him. We don\u2019t want to think that the contents of our graveyard have got themselves up in their best clothes to trot about among us, formulating opinions.</p> <p>Martha shakes her head. They\u2019re not like anyone I\u2019ve seen before. In looks or behaviour. I believe they\u2019re different from us altogether.</p> <p><em><strong>Only child</strong></em></p> <p>Martha\u2019s limp identifies her from some distance. It is of the lurching, stiff-legged variety, like a boat hit side-on by a swell. She uses a stick, for walking only, never hitting. When a beast jibs or straggles, she chides, like a doting granny, in a voice you could mistake for praise. She combs the burs from her cow\u2019s tail. Sometimes, milking, she seems to fall asleep with her head on Pluen\u2019s flank.</p> <p>The only child of only children, since Enoch her father died, Martha has no family at all. She can breakfast at midnight if she pleases, not even trouble to prepare dinner. She has grown thinner these last years. If there were a tempest, such as our forebears talked of, strong enough to strip the thatch from our roofs and topple animals in their stalls, it might blow Martha away altogether, leaving only her shawl hooked in a blackthorn.</p> <p>Enoch wanted Martha to marry Abel Pritchard. There was a conversation and a handshake and for months Pritchard would call to smoke a pipe or play chess with Enoch. On Sundays, Pritchard would walk her to church, and a comical pairing they made, Martha bobbing in the lee of his ox plod. But in the end he found a girl younger and quicker, with a dowry worth the promise. The bitterness between Enoch and Pritchard lasted until the older man\u2019s death. We do not know what Martha thought.<br></p> <p><em><strong>The Reverends</strong></em></p> <p>The Reverend Doctor Clough-Vaughan-Bowen comes all the way from the next county to see Martha. He lodges with the Reverend Rice-Mansel-Evans and early next morning the two men pick their way through a sparkling drizzle to the door of her cottage. Doctor Clough-Vaughan-Bowen is a learned man, of good family. He has written scholarly works, we understand, on subjects of interest to the clergy \u2212 adult baptism or the wearing of the chasuble. Rumour says he had a wife who died giving birth to their dying child. Rumour shrugs. When our neighbours and families suffer such losses we take gifts of hyssop or honey to their door, weep with them beside the new graves. But it is hard to believe that men such as Doctor Clough-Vaughan-Bowen have feelings as sharp or deep as our own. Mwynig and Brithen, we remember, bellow through the night that their calves are taken, but next day turn their inquiries instead to turnips.</p> <p>The Reverend Doctor has not come to reprimand Martha, nor to interrogate her. He talks, in his educated, university English, of which she comprehends a third at most, of many invisible things. Hopes and dreams and memories. The brains of horses. The souls of the dead. The imagination. The future. The swallows sleeping snugly at the bottom of the lake.</p> <p>He talks of the visible, and the traces it leaves. The fountain that sprang up where the saint pressed his thumb into the earth. The rock pierced by the giant\u2019s spear. The stony pawprint left by Arthur\u2019s hound hunting Twrch Trwyth across the mountain tops.</p> <p>You see what I\u2019m saying? he says to Martha.</p> <p>Martha smiles and nods at moments where it seems appropriate.</p> <p>The drizzle gives way to stumps of rainbow parting a watery sky. The reverends pick their way back and Doctor Clough-Vaughan-Bowen takes his leave, apparently satisfied.<br></p> <p><em><strong>French sauce</strong></em></p> <p>Martha has pressed her nose to the windows of Mr Ingram\u2019s mansion. The Invisible dine late, she tells us, but they light neither candle nor lamp. There is no fire even, but they seem warm enough in their cambrics and silks. The ladies\u2019 throats and wrists are bare. They drink wine as red as rosehips from silver goblets. The china is blue and white, thin as a blade, and the table is laid with many dishes. They eat roast meats with French sauce, fillets and cheeks and sirloins, veal fricassey, veal ragoo, snipe, partridge, wheatears, lark livers simmered with cloves, blanched lettuce, white milk-bread, parsley and sweet herbs chopped fine, flummery and posset, clary fritters, heaped bowls of gooseberries and mulberries and quinces, sweetmeats coloured with spinach and beet and delicately fashioned into multitudinous shapes.</p> <p>But who waits at table? we want to know. Who delivers the food? Who cooks it?</p> <p>Martha has seen no Invisible footmen standing to attention, no butchers or vintners at the kitchen door. The Invisible, she insists, are all wealthy. There are no Invisible maids or carpenters or shopkeepers. The Invisible do no work.</p> <p>But how can they live without the poor to serve them? we ask.</p> <p>What about the puddings, says Eliza. Are they spiced? Do they wobble? Are they eaten hot or cold?</p> <p>There are baked puddings and boiled puddings and set puddings, says Martha. Wonderful domed and turreted puddings, like palaces. Thick with candied cherries and angelica. The custard is yellow as buttercups.</p> <p>They sit at table for hours, she tells us, but they talk more than they chew. They don\u2019t gobble their food or help it to their mouths with their fingers, hunting down any fragments that fall and cramming them back in.</p> <p>Tell us about the meats, we say. Tell us about the cream. Tell us about the apricots and persimmons, the roast swans and haunches of venison. Tell us.<br></p> <p><em><strong>Englyn</strong></em></p> <p>We are enjoying a kind of fame. In other districts the gossip is of Martha. The Ingrams are mentioned in a number of sermons. The Dissenters make it yet another opportunity to talk of ale and tithes. Owen Owen composes an englyn on the subject of the Invisible that is perhaps not up to the standard of his early and most beautiful work but we admire its wisdom and one particularly melodious alliteration and some of us learn it to recite to our families as we sit beside our hearths.</p> <p>Markets are visibly better attended and at first we are grateful. But many of the newcomers spend only time, which they use to query and argue, cast aspersions, search behind walls and under trestles, inside calf cots and pig sties.</p> <p>If anyone asks what makes us so interesting, we have no answer. We cannot explain the Invisible\u2019s curiosity. Some of us speculate it may be convenience, a matter of location. Some of us wonder if the attention is always kindly meant. Do they wrinkle their noses as they walk past us? Wave their lace handkerchiefs to clear the air? Do they avert their eyes from our misshapen bodies and pocked faces?</p> <p>Mr Ingram has a gold pocketwatch. He consults it more often than is strictly necessary for someone who has no appointments to keep.<br></p> <p><em><strong>Ribbon</strong></em></p> <p>Some of the young people \u2013 Naomi Price and Megan Prosser and their tittering friends, plus one or two lads who are sweet on them, and Mot, the Prices\u2019 brindled cattle dog \u2212 have taken to aping the behaviour of the Invisible. They practise walking in no special direction and raising their eyebrows while others labour. They affect amazement at sickles and stooks and handlooms and potherbs and piglets. The girls have acquired a silk ribbon that they pass about between them so that one or another, usually Naomi, can wear it in her hair every day. They hold their skirts out of the mud, in the manner of Miss Ingram, and fan themselves with sprays of hawthorn.</p> <p>They have developed a sudden passion for knowledge, pestering Martha with questions. She indulges them until she tires or runs out of observations and then she shooes them away like so many finches. The next day they flock back, nudging and giggling, as at their first day of dame school. Martha tuts fondly and repeats yesterday\u2019s lesson.</p> <p>We think it harmless enough until they neglect their work. Three times, John Protheroe has to fetch his boy back to the forge. There is a great deal of shouting and a coulter is spoiled. Megan judges herself too good to dip rushes, while Naomi protests that stitching or churning will roughen her hands. The Prices are accustomed to their daughter\u2019s airs, but she has corrupted the once-faithful Mot, who now slinks away from his duties at every opportunity to bury his head in Naomi\u2019s knees and sigh as she folds his pretty ears into a bow.</p> <p>The Ingrams should know better than to encourage such foolishness, we say to Martha. You should know better.</p> <p>And when some of us point out that young folk rarely need encouragement, no one listens.</p> <p>We must keep them close to home, we say.</p> <p>The dog can be tied up, but our children need another solution. We give them more chores, more responsibilities, make sure they are too tired for mischief.</p> <p>For a time, we think things back to normal. But the Protheroe boy wears a look of discontent as he works the bellows, and young Preece leans daydreaming on a shovel, next to the lime he should be spreading. As for Naomi, she has declared she will never marry. She would rather stay a spinster, she says, than grow red-cheeked and loose-waisted with a man whose favourite subject is the pigs he smells of. She can be seen rehearsing for her preferred future, strolling alone through marble halls or colonnades of pleached limes, her nose in the air and a frayed gold ribbon trailing behind.<br></p> <p><em><strong>Unnavigable</strong></em></p> <p>It is July and there has been no rain for five weeks. The summer pastures have scorched yellow, then black, as if they have combusted from within, and we bring the herds down early. The lake shrinks. Insects clump and die in its rotting margins. Springs that have never before failed run dry. When the cows complain of their multiple empty stomachs, we offer them leaves and twigs. Harvests are poor all about the district.</p> <p>The Invisible are enjoying the sun, Martha tells us. They walk out at full midday to admire unclimbable heights and horrible precipices. Their hats are large. They spread cloths on the ground before they sit. They picnic on assorted meats, potted and pastried and aspiced. They do a kind of dancing, the figures intricate and indecipherable.</p> <p>What is the music? we want to know. Who plays?</p> <p>Martha shakes her head. There are no musicians. It is in the air perhaps. They take it with them.</p> <p>Rain falls every day of September. The drops gather and hang in fleecy clouds until the commons resemble the floor of a shearing shed. The earth, muddled by these disorderly seasons, squanders her energies on green shoots that will not last the winter.</p> <p>It turns hot again. Haf bach Mihangel. The sunsets are bronze, the dawns like unripe strawberries. The new quarry drops its prices. There is an accident in which two men die and one loses the use of his arm.</p> <p>The Invisible are busy at their sports and pastimes. Not throwing or sparring or chasing a leather ball. Games with mysterious rules and objectives. Mr Ingram covers his eyes and the others circle around him, calling and pointing. Miss Ingram gestures like a bird, or an old woman, and they all laugh. They tilt and balance and yaw and hop and fall. There is no winner. Or they are all winners. It is hard to tell.</p> <p>November. The storms beat at our walls, howling accusations. When the winds drop, the bone chill starts. We count the jars, measure what\u2019s left in barrels and sacks. Every creak is a stranger creeping through the darkness with intent. December. We muffle our noses, warm our hands in our armpits. At night we hug our husbands and children close to steal their heat. The salted meat is used, the pickles and dried fruit gone. We boil hide to make broth. January. February. Those with a cow are drinking milk and praying the hay will last. Those without are living on husks and air. The Prossers have sold their bedding and only a blanket donated by the Reverend keeps their youngest from perishing.</p> <p>The Ingrams must look across the lake, see our cottages dimly lit, some without smoke even. Do they imagine us huddled inside, stupid with cold, our fingers white?</p> <p>In the second half of March, there is a run of dewy bright mornings. The milfyw flowers, and we put the cattle out to graze. They skip and buck like the ogre\u2019s darling children, dip their heads to the celandines to admire their bristled chins. A soft breeze strokes our hair and we hold our faces to the sun. The frogs croak all night. The sparrows get busy in our roofs and we in our beds.</p> <p>But one afternoon the sky is spotted with peewits and golden plovers, fieldfares and redwings. They wheel above us, calling their alarm, then the snow they are fleeing arrives. It is the heaviest fall in ten years, heaping against walls, holding our doors closed. By morning, earth and air are so white that half a mile from us a new shore seems to have formed, before a strange, unnavigable sea. It is days before we can drive our animals to pasture, and when we do, bird corpses litter the ground, too many even for the foxes, and the grass is stewed.</p> <p>When Martha limps into view we forget to ask how she is managing and instead inquire after the Invisible. How do they like the winter? Do they startle when the wind jeers from their chimneys? Do their slates seal out the thaw?</p> <p>They play cards. They enjoy jugged hare and buttered peas, sugar cakes enrobed in sugar. Miss Ingram\u2019s frock is lilac, lit from within like a spring sky.</p> <p>We look at each other. We frown.</p> <p>Some propose going to the Ingrams\u2019 door to beg for work or failing that last night\u2019s bones or a measure of barley. We should get up a committee, perhaps, to remind the Ingrams of their duty to their neighbours. Some even mutter of going in force. We will don dresses and bonnets for disguise, paint our faces white, light torches.</p> <p>But some object. We don\u2019t need violence. Martha will help us. Let us be there when they visit, we say, as we have said before. Let us talk to them.</p> <p>Tell me your demands, she says. I will represent you.</p> <p>But it is not enough. We want to make our own case. We want to hear how they respond. Many of us are wiser than Martha. Many of us know more English. We will not be denied.</p> <p>The Ingrams abhor questions, she says, or importuning.</p> <p>We will be quiet. We will only speak when spoken to.</p> <p>They cannot bear any light but that of the sun and the moon.</p> <p>We are accustomed to darkness, we say.<br></p> <p><em><strong>Creaks and ventings</strong></em></p> <p>In the twilight borrowed from a clear night sky, we recognize our neighbours\u2019 heads and shoulders, their creaks and ventings, familiar from vigils and services. That is Widow Johns, that is Eliza, that is young Jenkin Jenkins, taking advantage of the situation to slide up close to Mary Probert. That is mice hurrying in the thatch. That is Pluen at the other end of the room, grumbling about a greasy trough or spiders in her hay. We yawn and sigh and stretch and fidget. We listen.</p> <p>And finally we hear something. We think we hear something. A padding that is the approach of feet softer than a cat\u2019s, feet that make no mark on the ground. A noise as of leaves or water, gradually increasing.</p> <p>Then a figure rises before us. A figure that is quite obviously, even in this dusk, Jacob, with a shawl draped over his head. He starts speaking, or piping rather, in a high-pitched voice, words that are not words in any language we know. We aren\u2019t sure what to do. Beneath his trill, an undercurrent of confusion and dismay begins.</p> <p>Come along now, that\u2019s enough of that, says Old Mr Jenkins.</p> <p>Jacob keeps on babbling and chirping. He totters in a circle, flaps a lunatic hand. Almost falls over Martha stepping forward to protest, almost saves himself, staggers again, knocks her to the floor.</p> <p>Then we are all up, talking at once, cheering and booing and baying, like a crowd at a hanging. Some help Martha, others pull the cover from Jacob\u2019s head. He is laughing. In a minute a rushlight is burning. Our faces glow red and orange, outraged, amused, disgusted, disappointed.</p> <p>So much for your Invisible, says Jacob, cackling. And some of us cackle with him. So much for lies and nonsense. So much for anyone who thinks themselves better than us.</p> <p>Martha has her face in her hands and Eliza is comforting her, turning every now and then to berate Jacob. Look what you\u2019ve done, says Eliza. And some of us join in. Look what you\u2019ve done. They will never come now.<br></p> <p><em><strong>Pullet</strong></em></p> <p>We scold Jacob until he agrees to apologise. He presents himself at Martha\u2019s cottage with a speckled pullet under his arm. She shuts the door in their faces.</p> <p>Although, in the matter of Jacob\u2019s behaviour, our sympathies lie with Martha, the incident is not unwelcome to everyone. His method was crude, we admit, but he has expressed our own misgivings.</p> <p>Others are confident that Jacob\u2019s stunt has only delayed our meeting with the Invisible. Next time, we say, we will be more particular with our invitations.</p> <p>Martha herself seems to have aged years overnight, as elderly people sometimes do, in a sudden haste to know their end. She will not discuss the abortive visit, nor will she deliver fresh news. Tell us what the Ingrams are up to, we say. Have there been parties or excursions? A masked ball perhaps? But she will say nothing.</p> <p>For a time, we make do with other topics. White peas reach double the price of wheat. Sucking pigs are 15s a head. John Johns and Ruth Prosser break their engagement and a month later mend it. Rachel Protheroe gives birth to twins. The hay is affected by mildew. In the next parish, we hear, a cow is struck by lightning and her calf bleaches white, not a shred of colour left in it. That, we think, is something Miss Ingram might wish to see. But when we say this to Martha, she turns her back.</p> <p>Some point to Martha\u2019s silence as evidence of deceit. Others defend her.</p> <p>It is shameful, we say, to treat an old woman with so little respect.</p> <p>There must be respect on both sides, we respond.</p> <p>We\u2019d sooner listen to Martha than to mischief-makers, we say.</p> <p>Fools are the best audience for foolery, we reply.</p> <p>Rancour and rebuke creep among us like fleas. Friends fall out. Families almost come to blows. Some of us declare ourselves fed up with the whole business and ready to agree with anyone who will leave us in peace.</p> <p>We start gathering fuel for next winter. We will stack it high this year, make a wall we cannot see over. As harvest arrives, we watch our neighbours at their crops and do not offer to help. When it is our turn, they reciprocate.</p> <p>Martha has become increasingly solitary. She is gaining a reputation for rudeness. She tells the Reverend\u2019s wife to keep her baked goods to herself. She shouts at two of the smallest Prossers until they run home crying. She rarely comes to market. When we do see her, we observe that her limp is more pronounced. She stops to rest often.</p> <p>Eliza brings us reports. Martha has a cough that will not mend. She is several times confined to her bed. We bring her the treats invalids are thought to enjoy, borage tea and calves\u2019 feet. She has no appetite. We keep her fire burning, milk Pluen, feed the chickens. When she dies (But that won\u2019t be now, will it? she asks, waking from troubled sleep), we will only need tell the bees.<br></p> <p><em><strong>Shadow</strong></em></p> <p>There is a new prime minister in London. Laws are repealed, laws are passed. Perhaps moths will benefit from the candle tax and robbers from improvements in the highways. Nobody asks our opinion. Like grass, we are meant to thrive unattended, underfoot.</p> <p>We watch the road and the bridge. We look especially hard at visitors on marketdays. In early winter, when a light snow falls, we walk around the lake. We see prints of fox, polecat, badger. Nothing else. As we turn for home, the powder squeaks, curling our spines.</p> <p>If we were rich as the Ingrams, we say, we would put up a stone drinking fountain and have our name carved on it for all to read. We would build clocktowers and almshouses and schools. They would all bear our name.</p> <p>Winter closes around us again. We have no heart for the seasonal festivities. We leave the wren in the hedge, the mistletoe in the trees, the mare\u2019s skull in the barn. We burn through our ramparts of fuel.</p> <p>To no one\u2019s astonishment, the Prossers lose their cow. Fecklessness, we whisper. We should take them some of our own milk, a little oatmeal too. Perhaps tomorrow, we say, moving our feet closer to the fire.</p> <p>When spring comes we are still alive. The day comes up a glistening mist briefly suffused with rose. We dig and trench, plant peas and early cabbages, blister our hands and break our backs. We inspect the walls and ditches we repaired this time last year, this time the year before. Some of us patch a gap here or there, some of us shrug and stare into the distance. The sun falls through the haze like a scarlet millstone.</p> <p>The Protheroe boy and Naomi Price run off in the night, gone to Liverpool, we learn, to seek their fortune in the Americas. John Preece gets an apprenticeship in Bristol. He will be his own master one day, he boasts, master of others. He will be an alderman, a mayor, with glass windows in his house and a gold chain around his neck.</p> <p>We give the pigs extra barley, thinking this year we will feed them until they are too fat to walk. They will have to sit down, like little gentlemen, to take their last meal. We will kill them early, have a feast whose memory will warm us through the cold months. Chops and ribs and belly and brisket, liver and lights and blood pudding. We will eat from one breakfast to the next, saving nothing. If we need a rest, we will lay our heads right there on the table.</p> <p>Sometimes, as we go about our day, a shadow falls. A blackbird clatters in unprovoked alarm. Sometimes we think we see figures on the stone bridge. They have no occupation other than leaning and an ease, leaning, that none of our visible neighbours could achieve. They are looking in our direction. We almost think they are looking at us. We lower our eyes and walk the other way.</p> <p>But at night we cannot sleep for thinking of them, across the lake, drifting on pallets of down and feather. And we wonder if they ever dream of us, or only of morning, when they will come stepping through the rushes, pocketwatches in their pale hands, passing through us like a breeze through leaves, a wave through water.<br></p> <p><em><strong>Notes</strong></em></p> <p>Tylwyth Teg \u2013 not fair and not people</p> <p>Twrch Trwyth \u2013 the cursed but well-coiffed prince boar</p> <p>Englyn \u2013 a short and obedient verse</p> <p>Haf bach Mihangel \u2013 the little summer that we enjoy about Michaelmastime, as rents fall due</p> <p>Milfyw \u2013 called by Linnaeus <em>Luzula campestris</em>; when it appears, we read poetry to the cows</p> <p><br>\u2022 Jo Lloyd is the winner of the 2019 BBC national short story award with Cambridge University.

New plants form out of fragments of existing featherworts, producing colonies of clones.</p> <p>\u201cThe trouble is that populations created this way may well lack genetic variation, leaving them vulnerable to infestations or ecological damage,\u201d says Dan Mead, a geneticist at the <a href=\"https://www.sanger.ac.uk/people/directory/mead-dan\" title=\"\">Sanger Institute</a> near Cambridge. \u201cIt is a worry.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"787371164ff4dd1d43293094eb724930dde268d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/787371164ff4dd1d43293094eb724930dde268d6/28_0_3730_2238/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The pale yellow plants in the centre are Carrington\u2019s featherwort, a scientific puzzle.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The pale yellow plants in the centre are Carrington\u2019s featherwort, a scientific puzzle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But hope is at hand for Scotland\u2019s lonely gentlemen featherworts. Next week, the centre\u2019s scientists will announce that they have sequenced the plant\u2019s entire genome, allowing them to assess the genetic health of its colonies and even consider cross-breeding programmes to reinvigorate them.</p> <p>Nor will Carrington\u2019s featherwort be the only beneficiary of this research. Wellcome Sanger scientists will also declare that they have unravelled the entire complements of genes belonging to a further 24 specimens of British wildlife. These include the golden eagle, the turtle dove and the king scallop, as well as lesser-known species such as the Roesel\u2019s bush cricket and the northern February red stonefly.</p> <p>Cutting-edge science should bring significant benefits to these species which in many cases are under threat from climate change, invading predators and loss of habitat. An example is provided by information about the golden eagle\u2019s genome, which should help conservationists pick healthy pairs when planning reintroductions of birds \u2013 as in a programme being considered for southern Scotland.</p> <p>\u201cWe started the <a href=\"https://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/collaboration/25-genomes-25-years\" title=\"\">25 Genomes Project</a> as part of our celebrations for the Sanger centre\u2019s 25th birthday, which is later this year,\u201d said Julia Wilson, the institute\u2019s associate director. \u201cWe decided to show what sequencing could do, not just for human health, but for the wellbeing of wildlife across the country.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"28307e604f8d727040b483e8023c1b4b0baac6f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/28307e604f8d727040b483e8023c1b4b0baac6f2/0_182_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian yellow-legged hornet is an invasive species.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Asian yellow-legged hornet is an invasive species.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The fact that Sanger scientists have succeeded and have sequenced the genomes of 25 species in less than a year is a remarkable achievement on its own. It took 10 years to sequence the first human genome two decades ago at a cost of several billion pounds. This time researchers took a mere 10 months to sequence genomes of 25 species and at a fraction of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/human-genome-project\" title=\"\">human genome project</a>\u2019s price tag. \u201cIt is not the case that the species we chose had little genomes and so were easier to sequence,\u201d added Mead. \u201cSome turned out to be bigger than a human genome, it transpired. For example the Roesel\u2019s bush cricket turns out to have 8.5 billion units of DNA in its genome compared with the 3.2 billion in a human\u2019s. The project was completed so quickly and so cheaply simply because sequencing technology has improved at such a staggering rate.\u201d</p> <p>These improvements in speed and cost of sequencing are expected to continue for several years, raising the prospect that full genome sequencing be expanded to include many more species \u2013 established citizens and modern interlopers to this country \u2013 in the near future. \u201cThis is a technology that has a lot to offer conservation,\u201d said Wilson.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e93e439c9c8883953e413e9b51bac786e856034\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e93e439c9c8883953e413e9b51bac786e856034/0_176_5315_3191/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Blackberries on a bramble, a medicinal plant.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Blackberries on a bramble, a medicinal plant.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Sanger team consulted biologists at institutions including the Natural History Museum in London and the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh before selecting 20 species whose genomes seemed likely to provide the most useful data. Then the team asked the public \u2013 via the website <a href=\"https://imascientist.org.uk/\" title=\"\">I\u2019m a Scientist Get Me Out of Here</a> \u2013 to select a further five species to add to the list. The winners of this vote were the common starfish, the fen raft spider, the lesser spotted catshark, the Asian yellow legged hornet and the otter.</p> <p>In this way, the team assembled its final list, which includes totemic specimens of British wildlife such as the water vole and the red squirrel as well as recent arrivals, including Himalayan balsam and giant hogweed.</p> <p>These were selected because an understanding of their genetic structure should help conservationists deal with the threats they pose to the British landscape. \u201cAsian hornets are now spreading into Europe and are causing immense damage because they attack honey bees and do serious damage to hives,\u201d said Wilson.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0090833d83bf1ad73fbf6303173f6c5748f70e86\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0090833d83bf1ad73fbf6303173f6c5748f70e86/0_188_5420_3251/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Giant hogweed outcompetes other plants.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Giant hogweed outcompetes other plants.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Similarly, giant hogweed \u2013 which originally came from Russia and Georgia and was widely planted in ornamental gardens in the 1890s \u2013 has now become a serious pest. Its sap is toxic and can cause skin blistering. By contrast, Himalayan balsam poses no direct threat to human health but is a problem because it outgrows native plants and takes over their habitats.</p> <p>In each of these cases scientists believe that greater genetic knowledge about the invaders should help in the biological battle to protect our landscape and wildlife. \u201cDetailed understanding of these pests will make it much easier to uncover their weaknesses and design counter-measures to slow them down or stop them in their tracks,\u201d said Mead.</p> <p>Not all of this work had been plain sailing, he added. Another Sanger target was the New Zealand flatworm, a major pest which eats earthworms that are crucial in maintaining soil quality. \u201cThe trouble is that when we tried to preserve New Zealand flatworms for later sequencing they disintegrated in our hands into a horrible zombie dust mush,\u201d said Mead. \u201cThey were extraordinarily unpleasant to deal with and definitely the most unpleasant species we encountered.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4b46e7681890de6575bbe132dd07cc6b74a88292\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b46e7681890de6575bbe132dd07cc6b74a88292/0_257_3471_2083/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Red squirrels could be saved by studying grey squirrels\u2019 genes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Red squirrels could be saved by studying grey squirrels\u2019 genes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Other genome targets selected by the Sanger team included both red and grey squirrels. \u201cOne of them, the grey, is immune to the squirrel pox virus. The other, the red, is not. If we can understand the root of the immunity possessed by the grey then we could perhaps think of ways of passing it on to the red squirrel and bring an end to its decline in Britain,\u201d said Wilson.</p> <p>Studies of other species could bring direct benefits to humans. For example, the lesser spotted catshark has the ability to regenerate teeth and skin and was picked as a Sanger target because it could help in the search for ways to improve wound healing in humans.</p> <p>And finally there is the mystery of Carrington\u2019s featherwort. How did the only two remaining significant colonies of the plant end up so far from each other? And why is one a males-only colony, while the other is a solely female domain? \u201cIt is clear that the two colonies separated quite a while ago \u2013 several thousand years ago probably,\u201d said Neil Bell, of the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh and an adviser to the Sanger team. \u201cBut how they ended up so far apart is difficult to establish.

If you get a good amount of seed, save some for tea: it\u2019s good for indigestion and flatulence, but not advisable if you are pregnant.</p> <p>You can sow the seed indoors now, or outdoors in mid-spring. Outdoors, I\u2019d pre-warm the soil with a cloche. Parsley has a huge germination range, from 5C-32C. However, germination often fails if the night-time temperature drops too low. The ideal temperature is 27C during the day and 20C at night. If you sow indoors now, you can plant out in April.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d5ab093af2eed5562855bf142a313f1228abcb46\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d5ab093af2eed5562855bf142a313f1228abcb46/0_21_1238_743/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Petroselinum crispum.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Petroselinum crispum.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Compulsory Credit: GAP Photos//Lynn Keddie</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Take care to keep the soil moist, but not sodden, until the seedlings peek out. Parsley likes to grow long and plentiful roots. If you want healthy plants from which you can pick all summer, you must give them space to roam. Thin the plants out to 30cm apart in either direction; if you are growing in a pot, put a single plant to a 10-litre pot. There\u2019s an old trick where you water the drill (where the seeds are to be sown outside) with a kettleful of boiling water before sowing (not after, as that might kill the seeds). The heat doesn\u2019t stick around, so it\u2019s likely that the boiling water sterilises the soil to keep disease and perhaps other weed seeds away over the long germination period. A second sowing in July and you\u2019ll have parsley all year round.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/27/how-to-grow-the-best-currants\">How to grow the best currants | Alys Fowler</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Flat-leaf parsley is superior tasting \u2013 try Giant Italian or Plain Leaved 2; but I have a fondness for the curly stuff, Champion Moss Curled or Lisette, particularly as a frill to the edge of beds and borders.</p>", "wordcount": "461"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}, {"id": "environment/2017/jun/29/pesticides-damage-survival-of-bee-colonies-landmark-study-shows", "type": "article", "sectionId": "environment", "sectionName": "Environment", "webPublicationDate": "2017-06-29T18:00:17Z", "webTitle": "Pesticides damage survival of bee colonies, landmark study shows", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jun/29/pesticides-damage-survival-of-bee-colonies-landmark-study-shows", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/jun/29/pesticides-damage-survival-of-bee-colonies-landmark-study-shows", "fields": {"byline": "Damian Carrington Environment editor", "body": "<p>Widely used insecticides damage the survival of honeybee colonies, the world\u2019s largest ever field trial has shown for the first time, as well as harming wild bees.<br></p> <p>The farm-based research, along with a second new study, also suggests widespread contamination of entire landscapes and a toxic \u201ccocktail effect\u201d from multiple pesticides. </p> <p>The landmark work provides the most important evidence yet for regulators around the world considering action against neonicotinoids, including in the EU where a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/23/europe-poised-for-total-ban-on-bee-harming-pesticides\">total ban is poised to be implemented</a> this autumn.

Addressing the differences between countries, Prof Jeremy Kerr, at the University of Ottawa in Canada, said: \u201cNeonicotinoid applications are a kind of reproductive roulette for bees. Depending on local environmental characteristics, they can materially reduce survival prospects.\u201d</p> <p>The $3m cost of the research was met by Syngenta and Bayer, the companies that sell the two neonicotinoids tested, as part of a voluntary commitment to increase the available field data. But the companies were not involved in the designing, conducting or reporting of the study.</p> <p>It found that the bees in Germany got just 15% of their food from the oil seed rape fields, compared to 40-50% in the UK and Hungary. \u201cClearly the bees in Germany are feeding on other flower resources in the landscape and are less exposed to neonics,\u201d said Pywell.</p> <p>The scientists also discovered that the wild bees were exposed to a neonicotinoid that was not even used in the trial and concluded the harm caused may result from \u201cpersistent residues in arable systems due to their widespread and often very frequent use\u201d.</p> <p>However, both Bayer and Syngenta expressed doubt about the \u201csimplistic\u201d interpretation of complex and \u201cinconsistent\u201d results. \u201cWe do not share CEH\u2019s interpretation and remain confident that neonicotinoids are safe when used responsibly\u201d said Richard Schmuck, director of environmental safety at Bayer CropScience.</p> <p>Peter Campbell, from Syngenta, said: \u201cThe negative and positive results reported by CEH could easily be random, ie not real.\u201d He said even taking the results at face value \u201cdemonstrates that neonics can be used safely or even with benefit to bees under certain circumstances, such as reported in Germany.\u201d</p> <p>But CEH\u2019s Pywell said: \u201cWe stand by our peer-reviewed paper.

Interestingly, the virus doesn\u2019t simply hitch a ride with the bees. It relies on the aphid to spread it around, and turn yet more tomatoes into small plants with poor-tasting fruits. So the virus exploits the plant, the aphid <em tabindex=\"-1\">and</em> the bee that exploits the plant. </p> <p>\u201cWe were surprised that bees liked the smell of plants infected with the virus \u2013 it made no sense.

An example, perhaps, of what\u2019s known as symbiotic mutualism.\u201d</p> <p>A virus is little more than a length of DNA inside a protein coat. A virus cannot eat, or reproduce. All it can do is hijack a host and use the host cells to make new copies of itself. The virus must then find new hosts. The common cold virus does this by making humans cough and sneeze and spread disease. The rabies virus does this by creeping up the nerve fibres into the brain and taking over, making the new host rush around biting other creatures.</p> <p>And the cucumber mosaic virus seems, according to a new study in the <a href=\"http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1005790\">Public Library of Science Journal Pathogens</a> to work by producing a factor that alters the genetic expression in tomato plants to make their aroma alluring - to bumblebees, at least - even if they look weak and wretched.</p> <p>Dr Carr and colleagues from Cambridge, Rothamsted Research Station in Harpenden and the University of Bristol, tested their hypothesis with eight years of experiments in glasshouses. The knowledge can be turned to human advantage, however: if chemists can reproduce the compounds that make the scent, growers could exploit this to attract pollinating bees and step up yields in healthy crops.</p> <p>\u201cWe would expect the plants susceptible to disease to suffer, but in making them more attractive to pollinators the virus gives these plants an advantage. Our results suggest that the picture of a plant-pathogen arms race is more complex than previously thought, and in some cases we should think of viruses in a more positive way,\u201d Dr Carr said.</p>", "wordcount": "476"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "football/live/2019/apr/06/bournemouth-v-burnley-newcastle-v-crystal-palace-and-more-live", "type": "liveblog", "sectionId": "football", "sectionName": "Football", "webPublicationDate": "2019-04-06T16:44:52Z", "webTitle": "Bournemouth 1-3 Burnley, Newcastle 0-1 Crystal Palace and more \u2013 as it happened", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2019/apr/06/bournemouth-v-burnley-newcastle-v-crystal-palace-and-more-live", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2019/apr/06/bournemouth-v-burnley-newcastle-v-crystal-palace-and-more-live", "fields": {"byline": "Ben Fisher", "body": "<div id=\"block-5ca8d7638f08ce46f07ea4dd\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-04-06T16:44:52.191Z\">5.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Sheffield Wednesday 1-3 Aston Villa: match report</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\"> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/apr/06/sheffield-wednesday-aston-villa-championship-match-report\">Aston Villa\u2019s Tammy Abraham rubs salt in Sheffield Wednesday\u2019s wounds</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ca8d61a8f08ce46f07ea4c7\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-04-06T16:39:21.730Z\">5.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Huddersfield 1-4 Leicester: match report</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\"> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/apr/06/huddersfield-leicester-premier-league-match-report\">Jamie Vardy at the double for Leicester in thrashing of Huddersfield</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ca8d5598f08ce46f07ea4be\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-04-06T16:36:06.623Z\">5.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Bournemouth 1-3 Burnley: match report</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\"> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/apr/06/bournemouth-burnley-premier-league-match-report\">Burnley move eight points clear of drop zone to ease relegation fears</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ca8d52f8f0852bbb93b31ca\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-04-06T16:35:18.465Z\">5.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Newcastle 0-1 Crystal Palace: match report</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\"> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/apr/06/newcastle-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report\">Crystal Palace\u2019s Luka Milivojevic leaves Newcastle looking over their shoulders</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ca8cf6b8f0852bbb93b3189\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-04-06T16:10:36.750Z\">5.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Or fill your boots with FA Cup action instead:</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2019/apr/06/manchester-city-v-brighton-fa-cup-semi-final-live\">Manchester City v Brighton: FA Cup semi-final \u2013 live!</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-04-06T16:10:46.021Z\">at 5.10pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ca8cd0a8f08ce46f07ea474\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-04-06T16:07:42.339Z\">5.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Real Madrid eke out a 2-1 win over Eibar! </strong>Karim Benzema was at the double to get Zinedine Zidane\u2019s side out of jail, with the Frenchman scoring his second nine minutes from time.

In an optimistic scenario, they could become available in as little as three years, but that would be likely to take large investment and a high degree of entrepreneurialism in the private sector, the experts said on Monday.</p> <p>Robots set to work in the fields would be able to target pesticides to the plants that need them, in contrast to current practices, dubbed \u201cspray and pray\u201d, which waste 95% to 99% of pesticides and herbicides because they are blanketed across entire fields. Most of this is wasted, but it promotes resistance among pests and weeds, rendering the harsh chemicals ineffective and encouraging farmers to use more. Some pesticides used in this way are also harmful to pollinators, such as bees, and their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/09/uk-will-back-total-ban-on-bee-harming-pesticides-michael-gove-reveals\">blanket use has been banned</a>.</p> <p>\u201cFarmers have been heavily reliant for decades on the heavy use of pesticides. Some spraying is very desperate,\u201d said Toby Bruce, professor of insect chemical ecology at Keele University. \u201cFarmers are spraying [chemicals] to which there is resistance. They will not be killing pests as the pests have evolved resistance. They will be killing other insects [such as pollinators].\u201d</p> <p>If instead such products were used in tiny quantities and directed by robots so that 100% of the pesticide was going straight to the plant needed, then it might be possible to resume the use of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/10/michal-gove-bees-pesticides-ban-neonicotinoids-environment-secretary\">banned or restricted pesticides</a>, said Prof Simon Blackmore, head of robotic agriculture at Harper Adams University. Such targeted use would prevent pests from taking a hold on crops, but would be so small it would cause minimal harm to bees, and be less likely to give rise to resistance.</p> <p>Robots would also be able to detect when fruit and vegetables were becoming malformed, which gives them a lower market value, and when they were too small to be harvested, allowing the harvesting to wait until they are ready. This would reduce food waste, said Blackmore.</p> <p>Robots have the additional advantage that they could, if they become available soon, ease the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jun/22/farms-hit-by-labour-shortage-as-migrant-workers-shun-racist-uk\">pain of Brexit already being felt by some farmers</a>, who are concerned about shortages of cheap imported labour needed to bring in their crops from the field.</p> <p>But Blackmore and Ji Zhou, a project leader at the Earlham Institute, noted that while lab development of such technology is now at an advanced stage, more will be needed to bring it to market. Many farm technology companies are wedded to the existing model of large vehicles and blanket spraying, and fear the destruction of their business model from more targeted and higher-tech approaches.</p> <p>\u201cI think the innovation will come from start-ups,\u201d said Blackmore. \u201cWe need to see more start-ups in this field.\u201d</p> <p>Bruce added that a complementary approach in reducing pesticide use was for chemicals companies and farmers to work with biotech experts to use already available technology such as pheromone traps, which capture pests without using pesticides and give an indication of whether pests are present and in quantities that require spraying. </p> <p>He said experts were also increasingly using plants\u2019 own genetic qualities to repel pests, citing the example of the <a href=\"https://www.rothamsted.ac.uk/orange-wheat-blossom-midge-managing-defences-to-control-the-pest\">orange wheat blossom midge, </a>a pest to which some strains of wheat naturally developed their own defences.

Males and females are similar, but the male is larger than the female. He is fiercely territorial, guarding his patch of lambs\u2019 ears with his life, chasing indiscriminately after competing wool carder males and other insects in a speedy frenzy of furious, high-pitched buzzing. He has spines on the tip of his abdomen, which he uses, or threatens to use, in mid-air battles with other males. Yesterday I laughed as a male took on a bumblebee three times its size, and won. </p> <p>The female appears more gentle. Like the male, she\u2019s nippy \u2013 darting from one flower the next, barely staying long enough for me to take a photo, but just long enough for a male to fertilise her eggs, before they both move on a few seconds later as if nothing had happened. She shaves the hairs from the leaves of plants such as lambs\u2019 ears, carding them together to line and seal the brood cells in her nest; hence this bee is known as the wool carder.</p> <p>I can tell which leaves female wool carders have visited in my garden. They look bruised somehow, with \u201cfingerprint\u201d markings that, on closer inspection, are revealed as having no tiny hairs in contrast with the rest of the leaf. Patient observers might spot a nesting female in action, scraping the hairs off a leaf and carrying them back to the nest in a ball beneath her abdomen.</p> <p>This is a first for my garden: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gardening-blog/2016/jul/01/build-it-and-they-will-come-how-i-created-a-wildlife-garden-from-scratch\">six months ago</a> it was still under decking. So far, only one cavity in my bee hotel has been used, but it\u2019s full and has the tell-tale fur lining seal, in contrast to the mud used by red mason bees.</p> <p>If you want to attract wool carder bees to your garden, I can\u2019t recommend lambs\u2019 ears enough. It\u2019s a wonderful ornamental plant, with grey-green downy leaves and inconspicuous pink blooms. Low maintenance and trouble free, it\u2019s quick to spread but doesn\u2019t outcompete other plants. Each patch in my garden is patrolled by a different male \u2013 their antics alone are worth a trip to the garden centre.

The most relevant rewilding idea for us urban beings?

Rewild ourselves</h2> <p>The first step is to change our way of seeing. I\u2019ve struggled with \u201cweedy\u201d patios and \u201crank\u201d lawns for a few years but I now see \u201ctidy\u201d gardens as they are for every other living species: desolate and hostile, stripped of the natural abundance and vigour that our soils and climate naturally serve up, even in the heart of a city.</p> <h2>2. Discard all pesticides, weedkillers, slug pellets and fertilisers</h2> <p>We\u2019re persuaded to apply far too many chemicals to our gardens and these are killing the insects upon which human life ultimately depends.</p> <h2>3. Decorate concrete</h2> <p>For those of us lucky enough to have a garden, we may well have a front garden which is now concrete, shingle or tarmac. The number of front gardens totally paved over has tripled from <a href=\"http://www.lowimpact.org/3-million-front-gardens-have-been-completely-paved-since-2005-lets-try-to-reverse-this-trend/\">1.5m to 4.59</a>m between 2005 and 2015, according to the Royal Horticultural Society. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jun/08/london-gardens-parks-paved\">London survey</a> found that the capital is losing the equivalent of two-and-a-half Hyde Parks of greenery a year from its domestic gardens \u2013 about 3,000 hectares (7,410 acres).</p> <p>Even if your front garden still needs to house a car, there is space for unruly nature. Plant a native hedge (young hazel, field maple, hawthorn and other \u201cwhips\u201d can cost as little as 30p each from good nurseries) or squeeze insect-friendly flowers such as <em>Verbena borariensis</em>, buddleia or English lavender onto your gravel. Think vertical in small concrete spaces: our native ivy (<em>Hedera helix</em>) is a superb wildlife host \u2013 a source of food for birds and insects, shelter for nests and a food plant for holly blue butterfly caterpillars.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg0iruZUGs\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qVg0iruZUGs?start=104&wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=104\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Watch our 360 video on rewilding in Patagonia</figcaption> </figure>   <h2>4. Pondlife</h2> <p>Just as water sustains life on earth, the single best thing for biodiversity in a small space is to add water. And you don\u2019t need much space for a pond. A washing-up bowl will do. I created a 50cm x 90cm pond, and collected some duckweed and other common pond \u201cweeds\u201d from a friend\u2019s pond. Within a year, it was found by mating frogs, newts, pond snails and damselflies.</p> <h2>5. Rewild our lawn</h2> <p>The trend for wildflower meadows leads to substituting lawns for sowing a meadow of flowering annuals which looks great for a summer and then dies away. It\u2019s often better to simply stop mowing. If lawns are old and not weedkillered to death, they are full of different species of grass and herbs, many of which \u201cflower\u201d as beautifully as flowers. I still have neatly mown paths and borders around my long grass. Orchid-lovers like to cut their \u201cmeadows\u201d in July but I leave mine until November \u2013 late seeds are food for goldfinches and a high autumnal cut doesn\u2019t kill the butterflies such as meadow browns whose caterpillars have fed up on grass and are safely hibernating in the turf.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5ce1932baa75193728201a188e50f27040a47e2a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ce1932baa75193728201a188e50f27040a47e2a/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A flowerbed that has been left to overgrow.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A flowerbed that has been left to overgrow.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Valery Voennyy/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>6. Don\u2019t over-plant</h2> <p>In an era of garden makeovers, we seek instant transformations. When we want a \u201cwild\u201d garden we buy wild flower seeds or wild plug plants or expensive \u201cnative\u201d perennials. But how about standing back for a year? Wild nature needs space and time but responds far faster than we expect. Do nothing but watch your garden and you\u2019ll be amazed by what pops up. A friend living on a modern housing estate in Leicester had orchids appear in his lawn as soon as he let it get a bit overgrown. My newly unkempt lawn suddenly sprouted oak trees (acorns buried by jays), hawthorn, holly, hazel and a profusion of oxeye daisies, clover and even cuckooflower. The things that find their way into your plot naturally are likely to be well-suited to your soil, and more likely to thrive than introduced species. The more vigorous arrivals \u2013 such as bindweed, bramble and nettle \u2013 may have to be managed so they don\u2019t swamp everything else, which is contrary to rewilding ideals. But then some bramble and nettle is superbly useful for hundreds of birds and insects. Even thistles are food for a variety of moth caterpillars and the caterpillars of the painted lady butterfly.</p> <h2>7. Relax our gardening \u2013 and our ideas about native and non-native</h2> <p>Cut hedges less. Let dandelions flower and seed. Allow a few poppies to flower between vegetables. It\u2019s hard for keen gardeners to relax. We also learn \u201cnative good, non-native bad\u201d. While we should use native wild flower mixes (rather than cheaper generic mixes which contain non-native species), we cannot turn back the clock and cities are full of non-native plants. Laurel hedging is terrible for nature, as is leylandii, but there are plenty of insect-friendly non-native flowers and shrubs, from buddleia to cotoneaster.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e7fd3c1962ed4be731001f17c6b9654a75c1da33\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7fd3c1962ed4be731001f17c6b9654a75c1da33/0_2_4752_2851/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A blackbird feeds on berries in a hedge.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A blackbird feeds on berries in a hedge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Melvin Green/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>8. Rattle our grass</h2> <p>Yellow rattle is a pretty little yellow flower which is parasitic on grass. It\u2019s difficult to establish because seeds need to be really fresh but I obtained some from my father and scattered them on my lawn. (If you don\u2019t have a yellow rattle-growing parent, try a reputable wild flower nursery.) Each July, I scatter the fresh seeds and the yellow rattle is booming. Grass is great but often too vigorous for other wild flowers to thrive. Yellow rattle creates the space for less robust flowering plants to thrive. It\u2019s the cornerstone of a vibrant perennial wildflower meadow.</p> <h2>9. Space for nature</h2> <p>We may only have a window box but there is always space for nature. We can cram dozens of wildflowers onto a window sill. Do we have a wall on which we can erect a birdbox? A roof for a swift box? (South-facing is usually too hot for breeding birds.) Or any outside wall-space for bug hotels?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b686eba53cf490defe6823415428169e192fd955\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b686eba53cf490defe6823415428169e192fd955/0_0_2448_3264/750.jpg\" alt=\"Urban gardening in Dover.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Urban gardening in Dover.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yulia Reznikov/Moment Editorial/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>10. Encourage wildness around us</h2> <p>Those of us without gardens can still shape our green spaces. Get guerrilla planting. Talk to neighbours with gardens. Persuade local schools or hospitals or industrial estates to leave some patches of long grass \u2013 or our local councils. In an era of austerity, we\u2019re pushing at an open door. Many local authorities are discovering that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/18/wildflowers-verges-conservation-mowing-councils\">allowing roadside verges</a>, roundabouts, hedgerows or parkland to become wilder can save money. Burnley borough council estimates it saves \u00a358,000 per year by reducing grass-cutting to benefit wildlife. It\u2019s also popular with voters: a Friends of the Earth survey found that <a href=\"https://www.foe.co.uk/resource/press_releases/huge-public-backing-councils-reduce-grass-cutting-help-save-our-bees\">81% of the public</a> support <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/18/wildflowers-verges-conservation-mowing-councils\">plans to cut roadside verges</a> and parkland less often to help wild flowers and bees. Dorset, Devon, Cornwall, East Sussex and Bristol are among councils to have adopted \u201cpollinator action plans\u201d.</p> <h2>11. Be surprised</h2> <p>In the course of writing this, my six-year-old daughter barged into my study. It was important: she was carrying a stunning <a href=\"https://butterfly-conservation.org/11908-11356/eyed-hawk-moth.html\">eyed hawkmoth</a>. She\u2019d found it in a patch of sallow \u2013 a scrubby \u201cweed\u201d of a bush. I planted a thicket of sallows (29p each) three years ago. They are the foodplant for dozens of insects, including moths and butterflies, and the eyed hawkmoth was almost certainly laying eggs on them.

But as any allotmenteer will know, the sad irony with seeing the first signs of new life burst forth is that it is usually one of the leanest months in the British veggie patch. Traditionally known as the \u201chungry gap\u201d, this period describes the window where stocks of stored autumn and winter veg are running low, but the first spring crops have yet to mature. The term is used so widely to reflect the UK season of growing that you might think it was an inescapable reality of seasonal eating at our northern latitude. Yet in other temperate parts of the world that still eat a much broader range of traditional crops, such as east Asia, this period is not known as a time of leanness but a time of plenty.</p> <p>As a greedy botanist fascinated with unusual edibles, what I have found most intriguing is that many of these prized Asian spring crops lead secret double lives as common ornamental plants in British gardens. Having munched my way through my fair share, both when travelling to their countries of origin and in my own back garden experiments, I would say that above all my favourite all-rounder has to be the Chinese cedar, <em>Toona sinensis</em>. It is lovingly referred to in Mandarin as <em>xiang chun</em> or \u201cfragrant springtime\u201d, and the young leaves of this stately tree have a deliciously warm, rich flavour and a distinctly bold onion-like aroma. In fact, for those unfamiliar with the plant, it is surprising just how \u201cmeaty\u201d or \u201csavoury\u201d a leaf can taste. It\u2019s a world away from the generic \u201cgreen\u201d or \u201cleafy\u201d flavour of the plethora of other veg that are almost interchangeable with kale or spinach.

Onions and garlic contain the same defence mechanism, which, as with <em>Toona sinensis</em>, ironically makes them super tasty to humans, too, with potential health benefits to boot. Their strangely familiar savoury flavour also means that, as with onions or garlic, they are supremely versatile in the kitchen, working well in the place of any other green veg in everything from soups and stews to saut\u00e9es and stir fries.</p> <p>But I have saved the best aspect to last. The species, in addition to having tasty spring shoots, is also a stunningly beautiful garden tree with peeling bark, rich green leaves and fragrant flowers that the bees just love. It grows extremely rapidly to form a stately tree in a huge range of soils. Pick a variety like \u201cFlamingo\u201d and you will get a truly show-stopping display of powder-pink new growth that can easily upstage any flowering cherry, but with a far longer display. Want to contain its size? No problem. They are very amenable to pruning.

Historically, her flowers have also been used in cocktails, perfume and animal photos (she mentions someone ordering roses for a photoshoot with a giraffe). Food is the biggy, though, so I head to Instagram for inspiration and find plenty. There are flowers on cakes, obviously, but also pansies with smoked salmon, violets on pancakes and nasturtiums on cheese. It turns out that the rules of edible flowers are that there are no rules. Inspired, I make a nice one-pot pasta dish adorned with violets, which quickly dissolve gently into the broth.

A <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809\" title=\"\">study published this week</a> in the journal Plos One reveals that flying insects surveyed on nature reserves in Germany have declined by 76% in 27 years. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/18/warning-of-ecological-armageddon-after-dramatic-plunge-in-insect-numbers\" title=\"\">most likely cause</a> of this Insectageddon is that the land surrounding those reserves has become hostile to them: the volume of pesticides and the destruction of habitat have turned farmland into a wildlife desert.</p> <p>It is remarkable that we need to rely on a study in Germany to see what is likely to have been happening worldwide: long-term surveys of this kind simply do not exist elsewhere. This failure reflects distorted priorities in the funding of science. There is no end of grants for research on how to kill insects, but hardly any money for discovering what the impacts of this killing might be. Instead, the work has been left \u2013 as in the German case \u2013 to recordings by amateur naturalists.</p> <p>But anyone of my generation (ie in the second bloom of youth) can see and feel the change. We remember the \u201cmoth snowstorm\u201d that filled the headlight beams of our parents\u2019 cars on summer nights (memorialised in <a href=\"https://www.hodder.co.uk/books/detail.page?isbn=9781444792775\" title=\"\">Michael McCarthy\u2019s lovely book</a> of that name). Every year I collected dozens of species of caterpillars and watched them grow and pupate and hatch. This year I tried to find some caterpillars for my children to raise. I spent the whole summer looking and, aside from the cabbage whites on our broccoli plants, found nothing in the wild but one garden tiger larva. Yes, one caterpillar in one year. I could scarcely believe what I was seeing \u2013 or rather, not seeing.</p> <p>Insects, of course, are critical to the survival of the rest of the living world. Knowing what we now know, there is nothing surprising about the <a href=\"http://www.ace-eco.org/vol5/iss2/art1/\" title=\"\">calamitous decline of insect-eating birds</a>. Those flying insects \u2013 not just bees and hoverflies but species of many different families \u2013 are the pollinators without which a vast tract of the plant kingdom, both wild and cultivated, cannot survive. The wonders of the living planet are vanishing before our eyes.</p> <p>Well, I hear you say, we have to feed the world. Yes, but not this way. As a <a href=\"https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G17/017/85/PDF/G1701785.pdf?OpenElement\" title=\"\">UN report published in March</a> explained, the notion that pesticide use is essential for feeding a growing population is a myth. A <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nplants20178\" title=\"\">recent study in Nature Plants</a> reveals that most farms would increase production if they cut their use of pesticides. A <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11829-017-9527-3\" title=\"\">study in the journal Arthropod-Plant Interactions</a> shows that the more neonicotinoid pesticides were used to treat rapeseed crops, the more their yield declines. Why? Because the pesticides harm or kill the pollinators on which the crop depends.</p> <p>Farmers and governments have been comprehensively conned by the global pesticide industry. It has ensured its products should not be properly regulated or even, in real-world conditions, <a href=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/357/6357/1232.full\" title=\"\">properly assessed</a>. A massive media onslaught by this industry has bamboozled us all about its utility and its impacts on the health of both human beings and the natural world.</p> <p>The profits of these companies depend on ecocide. Do we allow them to hold the world to ransom, or do we acknowledge that the survival of the living world is more important than returns to their shareholders? At the moment, shareholder value comes first. And it will count for nothing when we have lost the living systems on which our survival depends.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/04/livestock-farming-artificial-meat-industry-animals\">Goodbye \u2013 and good riddance \u2013 to livestock farming | George Monbiot</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To save ourselves and the rest of the living world, here\u2019s what we need to do:</p> <p><strong>1</strong> We need a global treaty to regulate pesticides, and put the manufacturers back in their box.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> We need environmental impact assessments for the farming and fishing industries. It is amazing that, while these sectors present the greatest threats to the living world, they are, uniquely in many nations, not subject to such oversight.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> We need firm rules based on the outcomes of these assessments, obliging those who use the land to protect and restore the ecosystems on which we all depend.</p> <p><strong>4</strong> We need to reduce the amount of land used by farming, while sustaining the production of food. The most obvious way is greatly to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/04/livestock-farming-artificial-meat-industry-animals\" title=\"\">reduce our use of livestock</a>: many of the crops we grow and all of the grazing land we use are deployed to feed them. <a href=\"http://www.thelandmagazine.org.uk/sites/default/files/can_britain_feed_itself.pdf\" title=\"\">One study in Britain</a> suggests that, if we stopped using animal products, everyone in Britain could be fed on just 3m of our 18.5m hectares of current farmland (or on 7m hectares if all our farming were organic).

What is wonderful about this short, sensual, embattled memoir is that it is not only about the painful landmarks in her life \u2013 the end of a marriage, the death of a mother \u2013 it is about what it is to be alive.</p> <p>I can\u2019t think of any writer aside from Virginia Woolf (or, perhaps, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/24/helen-simpson-interview-great-unspoken-subject-between-couples-is-probably-whose-job-is-more-import\" title=\"\">Helen Simpson</a>) who writes better about the liminal, the domestic, the non-event, and what it is to be a woman. I always feel, reading Levy (this is her second memoir), that she&#xa0;is a writer with nothing much \u2013 and with everything \u2013 to say.</p> <p>After her marriage breaks down \u2013 at a time when her career is ascending (she has been shortlisted for the Booker prize) \u2013 Levy and her two young daughters move into a north London block of flats which she describes, in its stricken deficiency, with panache. She makes of the flat a story, with its big skies and its sterile corridor (which, with playful perversity, she names the \u201ccorridor of love\u201d). She describes the bees that are her unexpected flatmates, her prospering strawberry plants, and the exotic oranges with cardamom that she and her daughters eat for breakfast. She writes entertainingly about her attempt, encouraged by a friend, at \u201cliving with colour\u201d \u2013 her yellow bedroom a garishly false move.</p> <p>Levy\u2019s style is shorn; emotional burdens are carried without surplus words. She describes renting the poet and playwright <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/dec/21/adrian-mitchell-obituary\" title=\"\">Adrian Mitchell</a>\u2019s shed from his widow, to write in, and it becomes, like the flat, a character: a shed of one\u2019s own. The affectionate portrait of eightysomething Celia Mitchell herself is delightful. She wonders why Levy bothers to wear pearls to work in a dirty shed, and introduces her to friends as \u201cShe Who Lurks in the Garden\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I read this book with indecent speed and greed but it deserves to be read at a pace closer to lived time</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is a little book about a big subject. It is about how to \u201cfind a new way of living\u201d. Rage is brewing just beneath its surface. But it\u2019s complicated, not least because Levy has a gift for homemaking. She writes about it as a process of \u201cempathy\u201d (she uses the word more than once), and reflects that it is \u201can act of immense generosity\u201d in women to \u201cbe the architect of everyone else\u2019s wellbeing\u201d.</p> <p>How, then, in middle age, does a woman who possibly never felt at home in her own home leave? How does she attain the same freedom as a man? How does a writer stay a mother? Levy notes the telltale way in which wives often get talked about by their husbands as \u201cmy wife\u201d \u2013 and are not named.</p> <p>I read this book with indecent speed and greed, but it deserves to be read at a pace closer to lived time. I particularly love Levy\u2019s amused curiosity about strangers. I was entertained by the saga of the elderly neighbour who did not like her parking her electric bicycle in front of their flats. This apparently insignificant conflict was an insight into one woman unable to watch another living a fuller life (my judgment \u2013 Levy shows but does not judge).</p> <p>I was stirred by the portrait of her mother, and the description of buying ice lollies from a Turkish newsagent\u2019s during her mother\u2019s last days in hospital, when these were all she could eat. One disastrous day the newsagent\u2019s had only bubblegum flavour left. Levy was distraught \u2013 but the story of the predicament made her mother smile. Levy was too devastated to explain in the shop why, in midwinter, she was buying ice lollies every day \u2013 until after her mother\u2019s death. And then the newsagents were \u201cso upset it was their turn not to speak\u201d.

Interviews by Imogen Carter and Killian Fox", "body": "<p>Art is more often a conversation than a monologue. Great and not-so-great artists have always wanted to surround themselves with paintings and objects that can speak to their own creative efforts. The most famous example of this desire perhaps is Henri Matisse, who as a young and struggling painter bought a small canvas by Paul C\u00e9zanne, <em>Three Bathers</em>, in Paris in 1899, for the then enormous sum of 1,200 French francs. He pawned his wife, Amelie\u2019s, jewellery to help fund the downpayment and paid the dealer in ongoing instalments. For the subsequent 37 years Cezanne\u2019s painting would be the first thing Matisse looked at in his studio each morning.</p> <p>Other artists have been more eclectic than Matisse in what they chose to surround themselves with. On the death of Edgar Degas in 1917 more than a thousand of the paintings he owned were auctioned, including masterpieces by Ingres and Delacroix and Van Gogh. The first Royal Academician, Joshua Reynolds, lined his walls with Rembrandts and Poussins, in the belief that some of their genius might rub off. Lucian Freud had a Corot over his mantelpiece, as well as numerous works by his friend Frank Auerbach in his house on Kensington Church Street, London.</p> <p>Not all the work that artists decide to live with is chosen for its profundity, or its market value, or its directly inspirational qualities, however. Often, as the interviews with contemporary artists on these pages suggest, the paintings and sculptures and drawings they co-exist with in their homes and studios have a sentimental significance; they are gifts or collaborations or a reminder of friendships that have been important to their life or to their practice. Like the rest of us, I guess, they have ongoing struggles with William Morris\u2019s dictum \u2013 \u201chave nothing in your house that you don\u2019t know to be useful or believe to be beautiful\u201d \u2013 and they live with the results. <strong>Tim Adams</strong></p> <h2>Rebecca Warren: \u2018Fergal taught me you didn\u2019t have to start with the meaning\u2026 you could let it develop from the material\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"aec03bbabd93bbabed421140ef8f5914269ab969\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aec03bbabd93bbabed421140ef8f5914269ab969/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rebecca Warren photographed in her studio with Fergal Stapleton\u2019s painting Hours (2010- 16).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rebecca Warren photographed in her studio with Fergal Stapleton\u2019s painting Hours (2010- 16).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A fine layer of clay dust coats everything in Rebecca Warren\u2019s east London studio, leaving its mark on anyone who enters there. Nominated for the Turner prize in 2006, Warren is best known for her voluptuous, craggy clay sculptures but she also makes collages and vitrines of intriguing found objects. She once said that an artist\u2019s studio is \u201clike a slightly crazy shrine to your own thought processes\u201d, and here beneath the dust lie pompoms and cat books, clay lumps and bright balls of wool. When we meet, Warren is about to move house, her art collection carefully bubble-wrapped in preparation, but she\u2019s keen to talk about one special painting, <em>Hours </em>(2010-2016), so has hung it here to discuss over cups of tea.</p> <p><strong>Tell me about this painting.</strong><br>It\u2019s made by Fergal Stapleton, whom I met when he was at Goldsmiths and I was at Chelsea, around 1992. It\u2019s great I met him because he had a very different way of approaching making art and I was finding it difficult after I left Goldsmiths, where I did my BA. His approach was that you could choose a material, clay for instance, and let the art develop out of that, and the meaning would follow later \u2013 because you had something brewing in your head anyway. You didn\u2019t have to start with the meaning. We used to do collaborations together, installations in spaces. We would often turn up with very little stuff and try to make something very specific to the space.</p> <p><strong>Do you think you both had to go through that collaborative process to then move in your own directions?</strong><br>It does seem like that. Over the years we went on different paths and I wanted to have more of a studio practice and to be able to make sculptures, things that I could send out into the world.</p> <p><strong>Why have you chosen this particular work of his?</strong><br>When Fergal showed the series that this is part of, at <a href=\"http://carlfreedman.com/exhibitions/2016/lo-ceremonial/\">Carl Freedman gallery</a>, I suddenly thought he\u2019d really hit on something. The paintings looked old, like they could be 16th-century or something, but mixed with this Fargo-esque, Coen brothers-style black comedy. We\u2019re living through quite weird times and this feels like a dark painting in a dark moment.</p> <p><strong>How does it make you feel?</strong><br><strong> </strong></p> <p>It\u2019s compelling. I really enjoy the way he\u2019s used paint. All the paintings in the series have this sort of indefinable thing about them. What are they? What are they doing? I suppose I\u2019ve tried to do this in my own work \u2013 to leave the meaning quite open, quite strange and odd. But I\u2019ve found that people try to pin you down. Sometimes I feel like, can\u2019t I just make a sculpture? People are always relating my work to some male artist or bringing it back to some other thing, some other influence.</p> <p><strong>Do you like to surround yourself with art that inspires you? </strong><br>Sometimes it\u2019s quite ineffable, you don\u2019t really know, you just see something you think you could look at for a really long time. I bought a Bill Lynch \u2013 he\u2019s an artist who died quite young. He made nature paintings on bits of old ply board. He was interesting partly because he really couldn\u2019t play the game. I think I\u2019m interested in artists who find that quite difficult but are making art against the odds because they can\u2019t do anything else.</p> <p><strong>So for you it\u2019s not just the work but the person behind it that matters?</strong><br>Yes, because the person shows in their work.</p> <p><strong>If you had all the money in the world what art would you own?</strong><br>I love Fischli and Weiss. I\u2019ve found them quite inspirational over the years. At Goldsmiths I saw this picture of a cat by them and I thought: \u201cWow, how can that be art?\u201d It was liberating. I love <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jun/17/albert-oehlen-new-museum-hard-in-the-paint-born-to-be-late-places-paint-above-pixels\">Albert Oehlen</a>\u2019s paintings, I\u2019ve got a little work by him. What else have I got? I\u2019ve got a very nice collage by Georgie Hopton. I\u2019ve got a great silkscreen by Christopher Wool which says: \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t like it you can get the fuck out of my house.\u201d (<em>And if</em>, 1992.) Maybe a Kippenberger would be good? That would make me laugh.</p> <p><strong>What about your own art \u2013 do you care about who buys it and where they put it?</strong><br>Yes, but to some extent you have to let that go. It can be tough. Generally I stipulate; something like, if it\u2019s on a plinth then it should stay on a plinth. Sometimes you\u2019ll see your work next to something else and it can be shocking, you\u2019re not sure how it works in that context.</p> <p><strong>What did you have on your walls when you were younger?</strong><br>My mum had a lot of Modigliani posters. Being young, I always used to be embarrassed by the nude women and would close the door if any friends came round. It was funny to go to the Modigliani exhibition at the Tate this year and actually see the paintings because I\u2019d been mortified that everyone would think my mum was strange, and then I realised, okay that was quite cool.</p> <p><strong>And has the stuff that you like to surround yourself with evolved over the years?</strong><br>I remember we had a really fantastic book of [Chaim] Soutine\u2019s work. I was terrified of it when I was a kid and when I look at the works now I think they\u2019re amazing. Maybe I was just so terrified by their brilliance? I had this moment recently where I realised it\u2019s all kind of there, brewing. As a child I drew a lot of doubles all the time, twin ballerinas. What\u2019s strange is that I had forgotten this, and when I was making twin dancers in clay 20, 30 years later, my mum reminded me about those drawings.</p> <p><strong>Were your family quite artistic?</strong><br>My mum was into pottery. I suppose it was quite a bohemian kind of life.</p> <p><strong>I know you\u2019re moving but do you usually have a lot of art and ephemera at home?</strong><br>I\u2019m quite tidy at home. I\u2019m quite particular about that. You want the crazy mess to be in the studio and in the work.</p> <p><strong>Imogen Carter</strong></p> <p><em>Rebecca Warren\u2019s work will feature in </em><a href=\"https://scva.ac.uk/art-and-artists/exhibitions/elisabeth-frink-humans-and-other-animals\"><em>Elisabeth Frink: Humans and Other Animals</em></a><em> at Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts, Norwich, 13 Oct-24 Feb</em></p> <h2>Paula Rego: \u2018I loved Vic\u2019s work and admired him a great deal.

Here she met her future husband, fellow artist Victor Willing. They lived for some time in Ericeira in Portugal, where Rego had spent much of her childhood, before eventually settling back in London. Willing died from multiple sclerosis in 1988 but Rego still lives in a leafy corner of London in a home packed with books, pictures and mementos. \u201cI\u2019m not particularly good at home decorations,\u201d she says. \u201cMy mother was but I don\u2019t really pay any attention to that sort of thing.\u201d Does she, like many artists, hang much of her own work at home? \u201cNo,\u201d she says. \u201cHopefully I sell it!\u201d</p> <p><strong>You\u2019ve picked out a painting by Victor Willing and another below it by Jonathan Leaman</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> How did these two paintings come to be hanging here?</strong><br>When Vic got very sick he couldn\u2019t work on his large canvases any more and so he painted a series of heads. He could do these in bed. In this room. This one is <em>Head VI</em>. Jonathan\u2019s painting was a present. It\u2019s a sort of homage to Vic so I hung them together.</p> <p><strong>Can you tell me about the two artists?</strong><br>I loved Vic\u2019s work and admired him a great deal. He was a magnificent artist and very helpful to me. Jonathan Leaman is a very extraordinary artist, rather like an outsider artist full of magic and curious creatures. I first met him in 1984. He came to see me at Berry Street in Clerkenwell. I had a studio there with no windows. I was painting on my knees on the floor, doing <em>The Operas</em>, and he said something like \u201cI can do that\u201d, which is funny because it wasn\u2019t at all like what he did. He left a book of drawings outside my door and I showed them to Vic and he was very interested. Jonathan came to visit many times. He and Vic would talk about painting. Jonathan is very knowledgeable and Vic enjoyed their conversations. Jonathan\u2019s father also had MS.</p> <p><strong>What do these paintings mean to you?</strong><br>Victor\u2019s is a picture of bones, a skull head with long blond hair. Incongruous. Gruesome and funny. It\u2019s more scary than comical. It\u2019s magnificent. Vic said they weren\u2019t portraits but impressions of people he\u2019d met or seen. Jonathan\u2019s is about Vic. Vic\u2019s initials are carved into the plinth with the broken windmill. It\u2019s like the windmills we had in Ericeira in Portugal. There\u2019s a rotting apple and broken wings and a dead bird. A gentleman\u2019s glove and a long bloody dagger. It\u2019s beautiful. Both pictures remind me of Vic.</p> <p><strong>What about the other painting by Victor (with a purple neck)? Tell me about that.</strong><br>That\u2019s the last picture he did.</p> <p><strong>Do you have a lot of art at home?</strong><br>There isn\u2019t any space. I have things I\u2019d like to hang but there\u2019s no room. The things in my house are mostly gifts from friends and family. Personal things.</p> <p><strong>If you could have any artwork in your home what would it be?</strong><br>I\u2019d love Picasso\u2019s <em>Minotauromachie</em>... It\u2019s mysterious.</p> <p><strong>When did you first start putting art on your walls?</strong><br>When I had the money. I remember we went to the Royal College of Art and bought one of Hockney\u2019s graduation prints, <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/hockney-kaisarion-and-all-his-beauty-p11376\"><em>Kaisarion </em><em>With </em><em>All </em><em>His Beauty</em></a>. I think it was \u00a37. They sent two by mistake so I sent one back. I bought an Allen Jones around the same time but we sold them both later when we needed the money.</p> <p><strong>Can you remember some of the first things you chose to hang \u2013 as a child perhaps? Or a student?</strong><br>I don\u2019t remember hanging anything on my walls. I did sometimes paint on the walls. Once, during the second world war, I decorated the wall behind my mother\u2019s stall when she was knitting items to raise money for British soldiers (my parents were anglophiles). And I painted murals at school. One of the first things I ever bought with Vic was a Goya print. Vic was finally coming to join me in Portugal and we met in Madrid.</p> <p><strong>Has the art, or visual material, that you have at home evolved over the years?</strong><br>I sometimes hang different things but it\u2019s not an evolution. It\u2019s for a change.</p> <p><strong>Are you a collector generally? Or are you a minimalist?</strong><br>What\u2019s that? <strong>IC</strong></p> <h2>Michael Landy: \u2018If everyone thought the way I think, the art world would be out of business\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1a51a643d08017e0dcf22e7e753b949e049191aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a51a643d08017e0dcf22e7e753b949e049191aa/0_0_4480_6720/667.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Landy photographed in his London studio with Jean Tinguely\u2019s Sketch for Heureka.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Landy photographed in his London studio with Jean Tinguely\u2019s Sketch for Heureka.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The ground floor of Michael Landy\u2019s house in Shoreditch, which he shares with his partner and fellow YBA artist Gillian Wearing, is a large, open-plan space with desks at either end and a sofa in the middle. Serving as Landy\u2019s \u201cthinking studio\u201d (his \u201cworking studio\u201d is up the road in Bethnal Green), it\u2019s where he develops the ideas for his work, which ranges from large-scale installations interrogating western consumerism to small-scale botanical drawings. What\u2019s striking about the studio is the fact that it contains almost no artworks at all. The one exception, hanging above a fireplace, is a sketch by the Swiss artist Jean Tinguely, whom Landy counts as a key influence \u2013 Landy\u2019s most famous work, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/apr/29/michael-landy-patron-destruction\"><em>Break Down</em></a>, in which he destroyed all his worldly belongings, was partly inspired by Tinguely\u2019s self-destructing 1960 work <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MqsWqBX4wQ\"><em>Homage to New York</em></a>.</p> <p><strong>Tell me about this drawing. Why have you chosen it?</strong><br>I got it as a present when I had a <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-liverpool/exhibition/joyous-machines\">joint exhibition with Jean Tinguely</a> at Tate Liverpool in 2009. It was a really lovely gift, and I\u2019ve got history with Tinguely. In 1982, when I was a textile student in Loughborough, I went to see an exhibition of his at the Tate. He made kinetic machines out of bits of junk, and it was an absolute revelation to me, as a young person, to see people laughing and interacting with these machines. I\u2019ve tried to harness that feeling in some of my own work.</p> <p><strong>This looks like a sketch for one of those machines\u2026</strong><br>This is for <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Heureka&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images&amp;iai=http%3A%2F%2Fupload.wikimedia.org%2Fwikipedia%2Fcommons%2F0%2F0e%2FJean_Tingueley%2527s_Heureka_2010-10-05_17-23-02.JPG\"><em>Heureka</em></a>, a piece of public art he made in 1964 [it now stands by the shores of Lake Zurich]. He didn\u2019t make many outdoor pieces, but this was about 8m tall and had moving parts \u2013 he\u2019s trying to create a sense of movement here through his marks [on the paper]. It\u2019s a hard-ground etching, you can still see the impression of the plate around it. I never met Tinguely but this kind of represents my whole relationship with him.</p> <p><strong>This is the only artwork hanging in this studio. Do you notice it every day?</strong><br>No, I don\u2019t really notice it, though sometimes it\u2019ll pull me in. I prefer things that I find neutral, I don\u2019t want anything that\u2019s too in-your-face. I don\u2019t have many artworks. I\u2019ve got etchings upstairs, my own etchings, but they don\u2019t ask anything of you. I don\u2019t have things up in my studio, I don\u2019t have references, or postcards. People wouldn\u2019t really know I was an artist. It\u2019s like I\u2019m trying to get rid of any signs of human existence, eradicate it altogether.</p> <p><strong>Why do you have so few artworks on display</strong><strong>?</strong><br>It\u2019s something to do with order. That\u2019s why I like to destroy things. People think of destruction as some kind of disordered mess. I actually think I\u2019m trying to create order out of destruction.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019ve destroyed other people\u2019s artworks as part of your work. How did they react?</strong><br>Gary Hume gave me a clown painting before I did <em>Break Down</em>. When he heard I was going to destroy all my worldly belongings, including artworks, he said: \u201cCan I have that painting back, Micky? I\u2019ll give you another one.\u201d I said OK, and he gave me \u2013 he told me afterwards \u2013 an inferior painting. After he saw <em>Break Down</em>, he said he felt mean-spirited, so he gave me the original painting back. I destroyed it in front of a German film crew.</p> <p><strong>So you did own some artworks prior to Break Down. Were they on your wall?</strong><br>No, they were in drawers or boxes. I\u2019ve never had artwork on the walls. I do have artworks again now, but they\u2019re all in boxes.</p> <p><strong>Are you happy to have them?</strong><br>I forget about having them.</p> <p><strong>You don\u2019t get that glow of ownership?</strong><br>No. It\u2019s funny, because I\u2019m a maker of things. If everyone thought the way I think, the art world would be out of business.</p> <p><strong>Would you feel upset if somebody stole this Tinguely drawing?</strong><br>Not particularly. Not because I don\u2019t\u2026</p> <p><strong>\u2026not because you don\u2019t like it?</strong><br>Yeah. It signifies a lot \u2013 about my relationship with Tinguely and how he really inspired me to become an artist in the first place.</p> <p><strong>If Gillian wanted to put art on the walls upstairs, would that bother you?</strong><br>It wouldn\u2019t bother me. But she\u2019s never mentioned it. Which is strange because we\u2019ve been together for 25 years. We\u2019ve certainly never had any of her art on the wall. But she keeps more things than I do. I don\u2019t really keep my own work.</p> <p><strong>Does she have a similar sense of order?</strong><br>No, Gillian\u2019s messy. But over 25 years I\u2019ve kind of curbed that. When we first went out together, she couldn\u2019t keep tops on pens, or tops on bottles in the fridge. We share a studio in Bethnal Green: she\u2019s upstairs, I\u2019m on the ground floor. She\u2019s been on her own in there for the past few weeks, so I\u2019ll have to phone ahead to be sure it\u2019s clean, or reasonably clean before I get there \u2013 for my own sanity. She has to do a quick tidy up.</p> <p><strong>If you could have any artwork in your house, what would it be?</strong><br>I\u2019d like Tinguely\u2019s <em>Homage to New York</em> \u2013 to be able to put that on in my front room watch it destroy itself all over again in 27 minutes. Although I\u2019d have to clean up the mess afterwards.<strong> Killian Fox</strong></p> <p><em>Michael Landy\u2019s new show, </em><a href=\"https://www.thomasdanegallery.com/exhibitions/210/\"><em>Scaled-Down</em></a><em>, is at Thomas Dane Gallery, London, 1 Oct-17 Nov</em></p> <h2>Lubaina Himid: \u2018What I love about this is that I can hear things when I\u2019m looking at it\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5325eec130d3f5509977fea791a2f9f3f2a509fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5325eec130d3f5509977fea791a2f9f3f2a509fa/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lubaina Himid, photographed at home in Preston Lancashire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lubaina Himid, photographed at home in Preston Lancashire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Winner of the 2017 Turner prize, and professor of contemporary art at the University of Central Lancashire, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/dec/06/turner-prize-winner-lubaina-himid-interview\">Lubaina Himid</a> lives and works in a handsome terraced house in Preston overlooking the River Ribble.

Her own works, which explore black British identity in vivid paintings and cut-outs, are mostly confined to the studio on the first floor. When curators call up to take a look, they pass \u2013 and admire \u2013 strategically placed works in the hallway by underexposed artists of Himid\u2019s acquaintance.

It\u2019s based on conversations that Magda had with her child from when he was very tiny to when he was three or four. He\u2019s talking about space rockets and stuff in Polish and English, but the English \u2013 like the word \u201cspaceship\u201d \u2013 is in phonetics. Sometimes, going in and out of this room, I catch a word and it sticks with me. I love the apparent simplicity of it, but also the obsessiveness of printing the actual lines on plain paper and then printing the text line-by-line, not all in one go.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019ve also picked out works by Tracy Hill and Rebecca Chesney. Tell me about them.</strong><br>Tracy\u2019s work is called <a href=\"http://tracyhill.co.uk/the-waste/\"><em>The Waste</em></a>. She goes out into the mosslands with a 3D digital scanner, scans the landscape, feeds that into the computer and makes an etched plate. So the end result, even though it comes from something very digital, is very old-fashioned \u2013 this is black print on white paper. What you get is the movement and the wetness and the sound of the place \u2013 for me it\u2019s a swishing, windy sound. In Rebecca\u2019s work, which she made during a residency at Yorkshire Sculpture Park, she\u2019s drawing the sound of the bees.</p> <p><strong>Do you hear bees as you walk past?</strong><br>I see the drawing more than I hear the bees. Maybe I can hear the sound of the pencil going bzzzzzzzz. None of these artists is interested in the romanticism of motherhood or mossland or bees, they\u2019re very much in touch with the realities of it. They\u2019re not your rural landscape artists, or portrait-of-mother-and-baby types. They\u2019re really bold explorers and investigators.</p> <p><strong>Are there certain types of art that appeal to you but which you wouldn\u2019t want to have in the house?</strong><br>It\u2019s a funny thing, I own a lot of work by black women artists, such as Sonia Boyce and<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/feb/05/the-place-is-here-review-nottingham-contemporary-1980s-britain-black-art-movement\"> Claudette Johnson</a>, but I keep it at the archive space that I have at the university \u2013 I want it to be seen in an academic setting, to be part of a wider network of conversations. Also I don\u2019t like to have too much of my own stuff in the house. It\u2019s disconcerting. So I mostly keep it in my studio.</p> <p><strong>When did you first start putting art on your walls?</strong><br>My mother always had paintings on the wall. She was a textile designer so she was constantly talking about art and beautiful things. She was never very keen on me just sticking up posters, but I was a bit geeky so I had exhibition posters and postcards rather than pop posters, and that was allowed. Mostly they were posters from exhibitions we went to see, starting from when I was six or seven.</p> <p><strong>Have you inherited your mother\u2019s taste?</strong><br>Oh yes \u2013 and lots of the things in this house are hers. I think our dream house, our dream interior, are the rooms of Kettle\u2019s Yard in Cambridge: Middle Eastern rugs, comfortable long sofas, bowls of pebbles, white curtains, beautiful porcelain. An English modernist interior I suppose, designed so that it\u2019s lovely to look at, without much thought given to comfort.</p> <p><strong>If you could have any artwork in your house, what would it be?</strong><br>A Bridget Riley, absolutely. I\u2019d have one of her gouache paintings on paper. It might have to go in my bedroom. It wouldn\u2019t be about showing off that I had it, it would be about secretly knowing. There\u2019s a difference.</p> <p><strong>Is there a certain type of artwork that you keep in your bedroom?</strong><br>Strangely, there are works of mine in the bedroom, but they\u2019re not works that I\u2019ve shown. They\u2019re experiments with painting, plants and patterns, very quiet things. I don\u2019t get too agitated about them because they were never intended for something. Otherwise I\u2019m full of doubt: are they good or not? [laughs] It\u2019s that \u201cbig ego, low self\u2011esteem\u201d thing that artists have. <strong>KF</strong></p> <h2>Idris Khan: \u2018Raqib is pushing the boundaries. His work is not for everyone.

Khan\u2019s own early photographs, in which he used layering techniques to draw out the essence of various texts, are mixed in with the rest, as are Morris\u2019s more colourful pieces involving misshapen balls and painted pegs. Amid this joyous cacophony, the work that Khan singles out is perhaps the wildest of the lot: a hallucinatory painting by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2016/jul/14/raqib-shaw-self-portraits-white-cube-gallery-in-pictures\">Calcutta-born artist Raqib Shaw</a>, whom Khan counts as a close friend.</p> <p><strong>If you\u2019re a minimalist, is the decoration of the house all Annie\u2019s doing?</strong><br>She brought the idea that being surrounded by other artists\u2019 work is inspiring. It can trigger something. And it\u2019s nice because as soon as people come into the house they feel like they\u2019re part of our world.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019ve chosen a painting, <em>Arrival of the Ram King at the Shattered Gates of Xanadu,</em> by Raqib Shaw. Tell me about him.</strong><br>I met Raqib in 2004. He was showing with Victoria Miro and I\u2019d just started with them. We met at a garden party outside the gallery, he looked me up and down and said: \u201cYou\u2019re the new Pakistani on the block, are you?\u201d Then he invited me to his studio. He was a few years older and he knew the ins and outs of the art world: how to work with galleries, how not to get taken advantage of \u2013 things you don\u2019t necessarily get taught at art school. And it was very inspiring to see him work. He\u2019s really pushing the boundaries of painting. His work\u2019s not for everyone, it\u2019s very mad and surreal.</p> <p><strong>When did you get this painting?</strong><br>It must have been before his first Pace show in New York in 2013. Annie and I were around at his studio all the time, talking late into the night, and he was generous enough to give us this, among other things. He does the outlines in gold and then pours enamel paint into each part and scrapes it around with a porcupine quill, making these amazing swirls.</p> <p><strong>What</strong><strong> is going on in the painting?</strong><br>It\u2019s a lot to do with Kashmir, where he grew up \u2013 the beauty of it, the war-torn Kashmir. His work is very autobiographical. It starts with him leaving Kashmir, then coming to London and dealing with the art world. Some of the characters, the really evil ones, are from the art world. So maybe the ram king is the artist and the creatures around him are the dealers. It\u2019s very dramatic.</p> <p><strong>What does it make you feel? Do you notice it every day?</strong><br>Yeah, I really do. It has pride of place over the mantelpiece. But for me it\u2019s much more about my friendship with Raqib and the world he inhabits.</p> <p><strong>If you could pick any artwork to have in the house, what would you choose?</strong><br>I\u2019d love to live with an<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/may/22/agnes-martin-the-artist-mystic-who-disappeared-into-the-desert\"> Agnes Martin</a>. Maybe <em>The Islands</em> series, they\u2019re amazing. I\u2019m inspired by the way that she created them all in solitude, the way she let her mind focus on one thing, pushing that to perfection. I admire artists who are very dedicated and stick to one thing. I\u2019d like a Cy Twombly as well.</p> <p><strong>Are there any artworks you admire but wouldn\u2019t want in the house?</strong><br>Not really. Even darker, harder-to-live-with work can be exciting. That said, Thomas Ruff\u2019s porn pictures would be quite tricky with kids around, even though they\u2019re amazing.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s it like having kids in a house that\u2019s so jam-packed with art? Don\u2019t you worry about things getting destroyed?</strong><br>They are really well trained actually. Since they were three they\u2019ve been saying to their friends, don\u2019t touch the art. Although the Yayoi Kusama pumpkin cushion we bought from the Tate did get ripped; the kids jumped all over it.</p> <p><strong>Did you have art on the walls at home when you were growing up?</strong><br>Absolutely not. Annie couldn\u2019t believe it when she came to my family home in Birmingham because there was literally no art on the walls.</p> <p><strong>What was the first artwork you acquired?</strong><br>My tutor in Derby was the photographer John Blakemore. He made these incredible still lifes with cut-up flowers. I ended up printing his work for him, and as payment he gave me one of his pictures, <em>Dissection of a Tulip</em>.</p> <p><strong>Did you get pleasure from owning it?</strong><br>Yeah. But I\u2019m not sure any of this is about ownership, it\u2019s more about what it brings to you, the memories it triggers. I don\u2019t see us as collectors at all. We never buy for monetary reasons, what\u2019s important is the emotional attachment. That\u2019s the thing about art: it\u2019s inspiring, and it also triggers feeling. <strong>KF</strong></p> <p><em>Idris Khan has been commissioned by the British Museum to make 21 drawings for their new Islamic Gallery, opening in October</em></p>", "wordcount": "5096"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}, {"id": "environment/2016/jun/17/sculpture-controlled-by-bees-wolfgang-buttress-hive", "type": "article", "sectionId": "environment", "sectionName": "Environment", "webPublicationDate": "2016-06-17T11:41:28Z", "webTitle": "The sculpture controlled by bees: Wolfgang Buttress's Hive", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/17/sculpture-controlled-by-bees-wolfgang-buttress-hive", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/jun/17/sculpture-controlled-by-bees-wolfgang-buttress-hive", "fields": {"byline": "Alison Benjamin", "body": "<p>\u201cMy approach to a sculpture seeks to frame nature so one can experience it more intimately,\u201d says British artist Wolfgang Buttress, whose 17-metre high <a href=\"http://www.kew.org/visit-kew-gardens/explore/attractions/hive\">Hive installation</a> opens at the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew, in London on Saturday. \u201cI want visitors to feel enveloped, wrapped-up and involved in the experience, rather than adopting the position of an external observer.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/19/how-much-do-you-know-about-bees-quiz\">How much do you know about bees? - quiz</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Its 170,000 pieces of aluminium, suspended from the ground, appear as a twisting swarm of bees from afar, but as you come closer it becomes a hive-like structure of latticework whose low humming sound and hundreds of flickering LED lights draws you in to a multi-sensory instillation.

Rather than following the conventional rooms-off-corridors approach, he arranged the patients\u2019 rooms opening into a shared living space and introduced privacy to a place that had always been configured around having no place to hide.</p> <p>Fujimoto\u2019s interest in balancing the needs of privacy and openness became an obsession. His first domestic projects are almost surrealist exercises in how inside can be separated from out with anything but a simple wall. Instead, he layers, nests and stacks spaces to blur the transition from public to private. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.archdaily.com/7484/house-n-sou-fujimoto\">House N</a>, built in 2008 in the town of Oita, Japan, is \u201ca box within a box within a box\u201d like a Russian doll, each perforated enclosure adding another layer of privacy as you move from the street to the centre of the home. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.archdaily.com/230533/house-na-sou-fujimoto-architects\">House NA</a>, built in 2011 in Tokyo, is the closest thing to a glass and steel treehouse, where 20 little glass-walled rooms are suspended in a steel frame, \u201callowing you to hop between the levels like a monkey or a bird in a tree\u201d. Perhaps tired of being performing monkeys for architectural tourists, the residents now keep their curtains firmly closed.</p> <p>His love of toying with the limits of exposure and privacy reaches its peak in one of his smallest projects. Commissioned to design a<a href=\"https://www.designboom.com/architecture/sou-fujimotos-public-toilet-in-ichihara-is-a-garden-escape-10-29-2013/\"> public toilet in Ichihara</a>, Fujimoto erected a solid wooden fence in an oval ring around the edges of the site, encircling a bucolic garden in which a loo stands brilliantly exposed in a glass pavilion.

I don\u2019t find it so much of a mystery, having spent the summer planning for and walking from the Royal Botanical Gardens in Edinburgh on what we called <a href=\"https://makeabeeline.org/\" title=\"\">a Bee Line</a>.</p> <p>This initiative was triggered by a visit in September 2014 to our former farm on the edge of Salisbury Plain. When we moved there in the late 1940s, there were permanent pastures, hedges and ancient drove roads lined with wayfarers\u2019 trees and carpeted with wildflowers \u2013 orchids, harebells, trefoils \u2013 and abuzz with bees, butterflies, dragonflies and pollinators of all kinds. Now, 60 years on, it is a silent landscape; no cows, chickens, sheep, or even farm workers, just contractors, and of course no birds, butterflies, bees or flying insects. Between 30 August and 6 September we followed our Bee Line, walking some 80km from Edinburgh to our home along small roads, footpaths, cycle tracks, disused railway lines, through open moorland. We saw few butterflies, moths or bees and even noted a lack of midges.</p> <p>The decline could be caused by a number of factors, such as weather conditions earlier in the year, but is exacerbated by the same things that are also damaging the bee populations.</p> <p>Agribusiness and its associated practices: monoculture, weedkillers, neonicotinoids, fungicides, molluscicides, and farming practices including pre-spraying of grain crops before harvesting and removal of hedges. Local authority and homeowners\u2019 obsession with frequent flat strimming and clearing edges of roadways, motorways, roundabouts. Loss of brownfield sites to development and the associated loss of a rich mix of plants and invertebrates. Treatment of garden bedding plants and seeds, currently <a href=\"https://www.foe.co.uk/living/articles/are-bee-friendly-plants-poisoning-our-bees\" title=\"\">being researched by Friends of the Earth</a>.</p> <p>On our Bee Line walk and while doing planning walks, the only place that was buzzing with both bees and butterflies was the disused railway line pathway between Broughton and Biggar, which is edged with bee and butterfly friendly plants. Even golf courses, which are extensive green spaces, can be managed intensively with little room to share with wildlife. On the moorland, which is managed for sheep and grouse, we saw just a few bees and moths enjoying heather, thyme yarrow and harebells. <br><strong>Meg Beresford</strong><br><em>Wiston, South Lanarkshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 The decline in butterfly numbers comes as no surprise to me at all. The one place in my parish where the range and number of butterfly species was high (or at least what might be considered normal) was a stretch of roadside verge specially seeded by the local authority with wildflower mixture. This attracted large numbers of gatekeepers, coppers and blues in particular this summer. The&#xa0;decline in not only butterflies and other insects but birds and wildflowers too is no doubt due to the fashion for \u201cgardening\u201d the countryside. That is, unnecessary and untimely mowing in particular and the planting out of what were wild spaces so that they essentially become extensions of urban parks and gardens.</p> <p>These areas may look neat and tidy, but it\u2019s playing havoc with biodiversity. Wildlife desperately needs what some perceive as untidy spaces or scrub. Habitat destruction by removing cover for protection, feeding, finding mates and breeding, not to mention overwintering, is more than decimating our wildlife. <br><strong>Graham Stocks</strong><br><em>Quorn, Leicestershire </em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>", "wordcount": "563"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "environment/2017/sep/01/summer-washout-drowns-hopes-of-uk-wildlife-bonanza", "type": "article", "sectionId": "environment", "sectionName": "Environment", "webPublicationDate": "2017-09-01T05:01:35Z", "webTitle": "Summer washout drowns hopes of UK wildlife bonanza", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/01/summer-washout-drowns-hopes-of-uk-wildlife-bonanza", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/sep/01/summer-washout-drowns-hopes-of-uk-wildlife-bonanza", "fields": {"byline": "Damian Carrington Environment editor", "body": "<p>The summer holiday washout wiped out a much needed bumper season for wildlife across the UK, according to wildlife experts at the <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/\">National Trust</a>.</p> <p>A normal winter and balmy spring provided ideal conditions for birds, insects and plants but the heavy rains that rolled in during August dampened the promised bonanza.

The gentle spring also drew many flowers into blooming early, with daffodils in the Teign Valley woods appearing as early as mid-February and elder and dog rose appearing a month early at the end of April.</p> <p>Moderate temperatures also boosted roe deer in some parts of the country. Glen Graham, National Trust ranger at Wallington Hall, Northumberland, said there was a much higher kid survival rate this year.</p> <p>The early summer was dry and the RSPB said it received a lot of calls about house martin nests cracking, meaning chicks had to be moved into substitute containers. But the warm weather encouraged insects such as the purple emperor butterfly, which appeared at the National Trust\u2019s Bookham Common, Surrey in mid-June, the earliest sighting since 1893. The rare and spectacular crane fly <em>Ctenophora flaveolata</em> was also spotted at Maidenhead Thicket in Berkshire.</p> <p>But then the rains came, disrupting breeding, boosting the spread of diseases and leading to fast grass growth, which swamps the small plants many insects rely on. August had above average rainfall and the first half of the month was the <a href=\"https://blog.metoffice.gov.uk/2017/08/16/jet-stream-brings-cool-and-changeable-start-to-august/\">coldest in the south-east of England in three decades</a>, according to the Met Office.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e9759aae8aa333194efd0f0e600be5e65c252126\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9759aae8aa333194efd0f0e600be5e65c252126/0_0_4320_3240/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The wet warm weather spells good news for fungi, such as the waxcap fungus\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The wet warm weather spells good news for fungi, such as the waxcap fungus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Corrinne Manning/National Trust Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Matt Shardlow, from Buglife, said: \u201cThe summer has been so disappointing that there has been a national debate about the sparsity of flying insects and the absence of unfortunate splats on car windscreens. In addition to summer rain the warm wet winter was deeply unhelpful to insects trying to hibernate. It has been one of the least bountiful years for yellow-jacket wasp I can recall.\u201d</p> <p>The damp August was also the likely cause of the failure of nests established by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/06/what-nottinghamshires-bee-eaters-tell-us-about-conservation-and-big-business\">bee-eaters at a quarry in Nottinghamshire</a> in June \u2013 only the third time in a decade such nests have been seen, according to the RSPB.</p> <p>The early summer heat followed by persistent rain is however likely to result in a good autumn for fungi, with waxcap fungi looking good on the National Trust\u2019s Golden Cap meadows in West Dorset, where 22 species have been recorded.</p> <p>Also benefitting are oaks, which have delivered huge acorns crops, and holly, which should provide plenty of berries for Christmas.

It\u2019s no wonder there are no insects in the world if that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing to your garden\u201d.</p> <p>Yet letting nature in to lend a helping hand rather than trying to fight it out is incredibly rewarding and will save you time, too. Even a small patch of stinging nettles or wild flowers growing undisturbed at the back of the garden can provide a haven (food and breeding ground) for a variety of insects including ladybirds, butterflies and moths.</p> <h2><strong>2. </strong><strong>Grow more flowers, shrubs and trees</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bbd97358b68d0fdb0bfc2dc857333ee1d8622e90\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bbd97358b68d0fdb0bfc2dc857333ee1d8622e90/0_1540_3420_2051/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Red campion, oxeye daisies and buttercups\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Red campion, oxeye daisies and buttercups are great for pollinators and look perfect in a wild garden.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s good to try to include a variety of plants that flower at different times throughout the year, but they don\u2019t always need to be plants that are specifically bought in.

Perhaps it was the animals\u2019 apparent willingness to eat plants normally toxic to humans that led to their association with poison antidotes. Specifically, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/history/shp/middleages/earlymoderncivilisationrev3.shtml\">bezoar stones </a>from the animal\u2019s guts were used to ward off the effects of poison. The <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25310610\">poison prevention properties</a> of bezoar stones were first put forward in the eighth century by people in Middle East, who removed the stones from the gastrointestinal tract of a local breed of goat. The name bezoar apparently means counter-poison in Persian. These stones can occur in any animal and are formed of undigested material such as plant cellulose, hair or, in a modern-day variant, bubble-gum. </p> <p>In the past the stone would be added to, say, a glass containing a suspected poisoned drink; it was thought to neutralise the poison, or, more likely, put you off drinking anything the goat-stone had touched.</p> <p>Bezoar stones don\u2019t work, by the way, regardless of what they are made of, or from which animal they have been extracted. Neither do goats have any exceptional tolerance to poisons. They may be gastronomically inquisitive, but even goats have their limits. </p> <p>Some animals really do have impressive tolerances to chemicals that would kill others. Some <a href=\"http://www.rosincerate.com/2015/05/rabbit-roulette-atropinesterase-and.html\">rabbits are remarkably resistant to the effects of deadly nightshade</a>; the <a href=\"http://poisonousplants.ansci.cornell.edu/adapt/lemur.html\">Golden Bamboo Lemur </a>can eat cyanide-packed bamboo shoots to its heart\u2019s content without any nasty side-effects; humans can munch away on <a href=\"http://www.merckvetmanual.com/toxicology/food-hazards/chocolate\">quantities of chocolate that would kill dogs</a>. Goats may not be very discriminating when it comes to food, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s all good for them.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.kew.org/blogs/kew-science/hidden-poisons-rhododendron-nectar\">rhododendron </a> leaf, like those left for the goats at Walton Hall, is certainly toxic, to both humans and goats. People are unlikely to eat rhododendron leaves and human poisoning cases from this source are rare. However, the poison is particularly concentrated in the nectar. Some species of bee that collect nectar from rhododendron flowers aren\u2019t bothered by the poison, but the honey they produce has been called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/oct/01/mad-honey-hot-honey-mead-buzz\">\u201cmad honey\u201d</a> because of its effects on humans.</p> <p>Most bees have several sources of nectar and the honey you buy in the supermarket is completely safe. But, in parts of Turkey, by the Black Sea, <a href=\"http://modernfarmer.com/2014/09/strange-history-hallucinogenic-mad-honey/\">red-coloured mad honey is still produced</a>. Beekeepers move their hives up into the mountain slopes in spring to allow the bees to feed on the flowering rhododendrons. There are few other flowers to be found in these isolated spots and so the honey produced is almost exclusively from rhododendrons. Consequently the red honey that is characteristic of this region is particularly potent. Most of the honey produced is blended with honey from other sources to dilute the toxins, but some farmers keep a few jars back for its supposed therapeutic properties. The locals add a small amount of it to warm milk for their health. But, be warned, much more than a teaspoonful may lead to poisoning.</p> <p>The cause of rhododendron poisoning is compounds called <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3404272/\">grayanotoxins </a>produced within the plants. These compounds are neurotoxins that interact with sodium channels in nerve cells. Nerve cells work like tiny batteries with a plus and a minus side. Inside the cell potassium is accumulated while sodium is pushed out and held outside the cell. When the nerve fires, channels open that allow sodium in and potassium out. This creates the electrical pulse that flows down the nerve. When the signal is finished, everything is shunted back to its original positions so the nerve can fire again. By keeping the sodium channels open, the cell can\u2019t reset itself. It\u2019s like trying to fill a bath with the plug out.</p> <p>The result of eating grayanotoxins is light-headedness, staggering, excessive salivation and, in some cases, hallucinations, depending on dose. Death rarely occurs in humans but the effects of these compounds can be so debilitating that in the past mad honey has been weaponised. <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mithridates_VI_of_Pontus\">King Mithridates VI of Pontus</a>, who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2016/feb/29/is-arsenic-eating-a-clever-poisoning-plot-device-or-recipe-for-disaster\">something of a poison expert</a>, deliberately placed honeycombs full of mad honey along the path of his enemy, the Romans marching under Pompey. The soldiers gorged themselves on the honey. Soon they were staggering and hallucinating and were easily defeated.</p> <p>It appears that the events at Walton Hall, whilst being very upsetting, were not a deliberate act of poisoning. A group of youths entered the petting zoo and fed the leaves to the goats. They were genuinely unaware of the toxic effects of the leaves they had chosen and their actions <a href=\"http://www.warrington-worldwide.co.uk/2017/08/01/youngsters-express-remorse-over-death-of-goats-at-walton-gardens/\">had no malicious intent</a>. At a meeting between the youths and rangers at the zoo the dangers of feeding randomly chosen plants to animals was explained.</p> <p>With the school holidays in full swing petting zoos will be flooded with families having a great time.

Not the brown- or red-skinned cooking onions that are the beginning of any good recipe (or are you a garlic\u2011first sort?), but every other type: ornamental onions, wild onions, strange onions, onions that think they are garlic.</p> <p>Allium is a large genus: there are 500 species, mostly found in the northern hemisphere, and we have been eating them for a long, long time. There are many worth eating, the obvious being onions (<em>Allium cepa</em>), leeks (<em>A. ampeloprasum</em>), garlic (<em>A. sativum</em>) and shallots (<em>A. cepa, </em>aggregatum group), but other, less well\u2011known species are tasty, garden-worthy plants.</p> <p>Part of the problem with my overrun allium garden is that I wasn\u2019t around to deadhead the garlic chives (<em>A. tuberosum</em>); now, they have self\u2011seeded everywhere. Garlic chives, also known as Chinese chives, have been cultivated for centuries in Asia. All parts are used and they have a delicate, mild garlic flavour that can be used raw or cooked. The unopened flower buds are good salted as a garlicky caper substitute, while soaking them in sesame oil as the base of a salad dressing is a brilliant suggestion from Joy Larkcom\u2019s book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Oriental-Vegetables-Joy-Larkcom/dp/0711226121\">Oriental Vegetables</a> (it works very well for Asian slaw and cold noodles, too).</p> <p>Still, if you don\u2019t eat the flowers, they will take over. When young and strand-like, they can be hoed off easily, but slightly larger and you will have to fork them out. As they age, the plants produce a thick rhizome from which fibrous roots emerge; they become anchored to their home.</p> <p>Another species, <em>A. chinense</em>, is also referred to as Chinese chives, Chinese onion or Chinese scallion, or in Japanese as <em>rakkyo</em>. It grows like a chive; the bright-green leaves are hollow, but more sharply angled than chives. They also die back during their dormant period in midsummer and flower in autumn once they have grown back. The striking flowers are pinkish-purple to lavender. Below ground, they grow a bulb that has reddish-brown skin and pink flesh. They don\u2019t tend to get big until their third season, when they can be harvested and eaten like a mild shallot. You sometimes find the bulbs for sale in oriental supermarkets. Plant them in pots in free-draining compost in spring or summer and they will start to grow in autumn; they can be harvested the following year or left to bulk up. They don\u2019t do well with competition, so make sure they are grown in full sun.</p> <p>Finally, there is Hooker\u2019s onion (<em>A. hookeri</em>), which I sourced from Paul Barney of <a href=\"https://www.edulis.co.uk/\">Edulis Nursery</a> in Berkshire. He brought it back from south-east Asia and has named a clone, <a href=\"https://www.edulis.co.uk/products/allium-hookeri-zorami\">Zorami</a>, after his daughter (which to my mind is very cool \u2013 who wants a rose when you could have an onion named after you?). This is another perennial where all parts are edible, the wide, fleshy leaves used as an onion substitute, but Barney suggests it is worth growing for its roots, which are white, fleshy and make for very good eating. Zorami is a particularly good clone, because it repeat flowers from June to October, which, among other things, makes for very happy bees.</p>", "wordcount": "537"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}, {"id": "higher-education-network/2017/mar/30/sustainability-project-category-award-winner-and-runner-up", "type": "article", "sectionId": "education", "sectionName": "Education", "webPublicationDate": "2017-03-30T06:30:20Z", "webTitle": "Sustainability project category: award winner and runner up", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2017/mar/30/sustainability-project-category-award-winner-and-runner-up", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/higher-education-network/2017/mar/30/sustainability-project-category-award-winner-and-runner-up", "fields": {"body": "<h2>Winner: Cardiff University</h2> <h2>Project: A bee-friendly university <br></h2> <p>Bees are essential to the survival of our planet, yet their numbers have declined significantly over the past few years. People are being encouraged to plant a variety of wildflowers to ensure that bee numbers don\u2019t dwindle further. Scientists at Cardiff University are playing their part by working towards becoming the first bee-friendly university in Wales. The university is creating a habitat that benefits all urban pollinators and, by planting certain wildflowers whose nectar is present in antibacterial honey, it is also searching for a solution to antimicrobial resistance. </p> <p>A team based in the school of pharmacy and pharmaceutical sciences is using honey in an attempt to find new drugs to treat hospital infections caused by antibiotic resistant superbugs. Having identified the plants favoured by bees producing antimicrobial honey, they have now started to naturally reproduce the honey on campus, as well as encouraging local schools and communities to have their own bee hives.</p> <p>The project has been rolled out to local schools, allowing the university to interest children in science and the natural world, as well as raising the aspirations among groups traditionally under-represented in higher education.</p> <p>Since mid-2015, the university has received funding to partner with organisations across south Wales to enrich the biodiversity of green spaces. This has included \u00a314,000 from the Welsh government to support Tetto Verde, a project creating green spaces in urban areas; \u00a39,500 from the Wellcome Trust to support local schools in integrating bees and biodiversity into their teaching; \u00a320,000 to develop a bee-friendly green roof covering to enrich the urban environment; \u00a312,000 to work with historian colleagues to explore ancient honey-based wound dressing as a source of modern drugs; and \u00a35,000 from Santander to support Spot a Bee, a citizen science project creating a map of Cardiff showing which plants have been visited by local bees and where they are located.</p> <h2>Runner up: Swansea University</h2> <h2>Project: SWell<br></h2> <p>SWell (Sustainability and Wellbeing) is an app-based project pulling together multiple initiatives, campaigns and events. It uses personal wellbeing, care for others and the environment, rewards and gamification to create visible communities that make positive impacts.</p> <p> Individual input takes two minutes per week; actions are recorded and added to departmental activity. Some actions are self-reported while others centrally monitored. The project aimed to engage people who don\u2019t usually get involved with environmental initiatives. It also focuses on the carrot, and not the stick, approach, celebrating people\u2019s positive steps rather than casting blame. There is no compulsory criteria; staff can do as little or as much as they wish.</p> <p>Small prizes are awarded for reaching personal milestones, with larger annual rewards for the best performing departments across eight themes including carbon reduction, community volunteering and active travel. An annual celebration of the best performing departments is held, with winners able to donate prize money to a variety of local charities with a link to each theme. </p> <p>Startup costs related to setting up the SWell project and app were \u00a34,400 funded from the university\u2019s sustainability projects budget. Annual running costs, including rewards, are around \u00a310,000. Many rewards are donated, including from within the university.</p> <p>Through SWell, staff are undertaking over 20,000 actions each month. Such actions might include attending a beach clean or travel champion training, organising a more sustainable event, or ditching disposables in favour of reusable cups.</p> <p>In one year the university has seen a 19% reduction in carbon intensity, while recycling is up to 64% from 46%.

And it is their success \u2013 staggering, unparalleled and seemingly endless \u2013 which makes all the more alarming the great truth now dawning upon us: insects as a group are in terrible trouble and the remorselessly expanding human enterprise has become too much, even for them.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Does it matter?

Even if bugs make you shudder? Oh yes. Insects are vital plant-pollinators and although most of our grain crops are pollinated by the wind, most of our fruit crops are insect-pollinated, as are the vast majority of our wild plants, from daisies to our most splendid wild flower, the rare and beautiful lady\u2019s slipper orchid.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2017-10-18T08:07:49/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2017-10-18T08:07:49/embed.html\">Chart</a> </figure>  <p>Furthermore, insects form the base of thousands upon thousands of food chains, and their disappearance is a principal reason why Britain\u2019s farmland birds have more than halved in number since 1970. Some declines have been catastrophic: the grey partridge, whose chicks fed on the insects once abundant in cornfields, and the charming spotted flycatcher, a specialist predator of aerial insects, have both declined by more than 95%, while the red-backed shrike, which feeds on big beetles, became extinct in Britain in the 1990s. </p> <p>Ecologically, catastrophe is the word for it. </p> <p>It has taken us a lot of time to understand this for two reasons: one cultural, one scientific. Firstly, we generally do not care for insects (bees and butterflies excepted). Even wildlife lovers are fixed on vertebrates, on creatures of fur and feather and especially the \u201ccharismatic megafauna\u201d, and in the population as a whole there is even less sympathy for the fate of the chitin-skeletoned little things that creep and crawl; our default reaction is a shudder. Fewer bugs in the world? Many would cheer.</p> <p>Secondly, for the overwhelming majority of insect species, there is no monitoring or measurement of numbers taking place. It is a practical impossibility: in the UK alone there are about 24,500 insect species \u2013 about 1,800 species of bugs, 4,000 species of beetles, 7,000 species of flies and another 7,000 species of bees, wasps and ants \u2013 and most are unknown to all but a few specialists. So their vast and catastrophic decline, at last perceptible, has crept up on us; and when first we began to perceive it, it was not through statistics, but through anecdote. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gardening-blog/2016/sep/21/britain-insect-population\">Where have all the insects gone? | Charlie Hart</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The earliest anecdotal impression of decline was through what is sometimes termed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gardening-blog/2016/sep/21/britain-insect-population\">windscreen phenomenon</a> (or windshield if you live in the US): time was, especially in the summer, when any long automobile journey would result in a car windscreen that was insect-spattered. But then, not so much. Two years ago I wrote a book focusing on this curious happening, but I gave it a different name: I called it the moth snowstorm, referring to the moths which on summer nights in my childhood might cluster in such numbers that they would pack a speeding car\u2019s headlight beams like snowflakes in a blizzard. </p> <p>But the point about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/16/rainbow-dust-the-moth-snowstorm-in-pursuit-of-butterflies-review\">moth snowstorm</a> was this: it had gone. I personally realised it had disappeared, and began writing about it as a journalist, in the year 2000; but it became obvious from talking to people who had also observed it that its disappearance dated further back, probably to about the 1970s and 1980s. And the fact that an entire large-scale phenomenon such as this had simply ceased to exist pointed inescapably to one grim conclusion: though unnoticed by the world at large, a whole giant ecosystem was collapsing. The insect world was falling apart. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2caad2b0949b681c55611c03eb62a2293d91c042\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2caad2b0949b681c55611c03eb62a2293d91c042/0_0_4640_3093/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Moths are also in steep decline.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Moths are in steep decline.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Today we know beyond doubt, and with <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/18/warning-of-ecological-armageddon-after-dramatic-plunge-in-insect-numbers\">scientific statistics</a> rather than just anecdote, that this is true, and the question immediately arises: what caused it?</p> <p>It seems indisputable: it is us.

This is the true price of pesticide-based agriculture, which society has for so long blithely accepted. </p> <p>So what is the future for 21st-century insects? It will be worse still, as we struggle to feed the nine billion people expected to be inhabiting the world by 2050, and the possible 12 billion by 2100, and agriculture intensifies even further to let us do so. You think there will be fewer insecticides sprayed on farmlands around the globe in the years to come? Think again. It is the most uncomfortable of truths, but one which stares us in the face: that even the most successful organisms that have ever existed on earth are now being overwhelmed by the titanic scale of the human enterprise, as indeed, is the whole natural world.<br></p> <p>\u2022 Michael McCarthy is a writer, naturalist, and author of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/16/rainbow-dust-the-moth-snowstorm-in-pursuit-of-butterflies-review\">The Moth Snowstorm: Nature and Joy</a><br></p>", "wordcount": "1184"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "environment/2016/oct/23/beetle-pest-rosemary-sage-lavender-herbs-specieswatch", "type": "article", "sectionId": "environment", "sectionName": "Environment", "webPublicationDate": "2016-10-23T20:30:10Z", "webTitle": "A handsome pest with a taste for aromatic plants", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/23/beetle-pest-rosemary-sage-lavender-herbs-specieswatch", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/oct/23/beetle-pest-rosemary-sage-lavender-herbs-specieswatch", "fields": {"byline": "Paul Brown", "body": "<p>If you discover your favourite aromatic plants and herbs are looking chewed this autumn the culprit is almost certainly the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2006/apr/18/gardens\">rosemary beetle</a> <em>(</em><em>Chrysolina Americana), </em>an unwelcome new addition to the UK\u2019s gardens \u2013 thanks to climate change.</p> <p>Despite its name, <em>Americana, </em>its original home is the Mediterranean and North Africa, but the increasing warmth of the British climate means it can now survive and thrive here.

Most pesticides which kill the beetles and their lava, also render the herbs uneatable, although the RHS suggest some brands that the makers say are not harmful to humans. However, pesticides will also kill a lot of beneficial insects including bees.</p> <p>Picking the adult beetles off is laborious so the RHS recommends giving the plants a good shake. On the advice site is a helpful video demonstrating how to place a big piece of white paper under a rosemary bush to catch them all. Someone else suggested an upturned umbrella.

However, the beetles have no natural predators in this country and will soon re-emerge, so control will be needed.

Raphael, an older man who nurses a dark secret, has faced similar horrors before escaping a&#xa0;totalitarian regime and fleeing to London. Hera\u2019s devotion to the man she first sees in a cafe is beautifully drawn: \u201cI still had no idea how old you were. But I didn\u2019t care. I&#xa0;just wanted to sleep with you.\u201d</p> <p>Disappearance is a theme of Sri Lankan-born Tearne\u2019s often affecting novel. Now, after 27 years, the ice is melting, and Hera begins to face up&#xa0;to&#xa0;her past. The scenes of post-apocalyptic London are compelling enough: the novel begins with Hera walking along The Cut, just behind the South Bank, and seeing a street sign released from its white prison for the first time in decades. But although the novel is intentionally dreamlike at times (with such a strange landscape, it&#xa0;could scarcely be anything else), this means that it lacks focus.</p> <p>It seems as if every plague that could hit a country has done so: the arrival of a perpetual winter, a pre-existing fuel shortage, food shortages, a rise in Islamic terrorism, even an actual plague.Although some of these disasters are&#xa0;contingent on one another (you can\u2019t grow food in sub-zero temperatures), Tearne\u2019s dystopia feels as though she has thrown everything at&#xa0;it.&#xa0;The precision employed in, say, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/mar/08/science-fiction-roundup-reviews\" title=\"\">Adrian Barnes\u2019s <em>Nod</em></a>, where society is devastated by collective permanent insomnia, or Emily St John Mandel\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/25/station-eleven-review-emily-st-john-mandel\" title=\"\"><em>Station Eleven</em></a>, in which the majority of&#xa0;humanity is wiped out by a virulent flu strain, is missing here. And it is that&#xa0;precision that makes the best post-apocalyptic novels seem so horribly plausible.</p> <p>Tearne sets up her world, but she doesn\u2019t quite trust her readers to work&#xa0;things out for themselves, so we&#xa0;occasionally hear what sounds suspiciously like the author\u2019s voice through the narrator\u2019s: \u201cWith the scarcity of bees \u2013 no government had stopped the use of pesticides in spite of&#xa0;all the protests \u2013 some plants had died out.\u201d</p> <p>The novel is at its best when it concentrates on Hera and the disconnection she feels from her family and her background. In the aftermath of Aslam\u2019s arrest, she is chastised by a superstitious neighbour. \u201cI wanted to punch her, to shout, to run out of the house. I&#xa0;felt as though I was drowning in my childhood. My whole life has been one long struggle to survive, I wanted to scream at them&#xa0;both. Being born in the&#xa0;West isn\u2019t&#xa0;enough.\u201d</p> <p>The use of names from Greek myth is a curious choice \u2013 Hera shows little sign of resembling her goddess-namesake, any more than Hektor seems a tower of strength for his beleaguered family. Scylla is a local soothsayer, but not sea-monsterish. That Raphael has a Spanish-Greek name (Raphael Kalchas \u2013 the latter the name of a Greek priest in the Trojan war) blurs the difference between his background (non-specifically South American, though the book\u2019s acknowledgments imply Chilean) and Hera\u2019s, and thus their affair feels less transgressive, and less magical.</p> <p>The Trojan war is cited as an archetypally futile conflict, but that doesn\u2019t seem reason enough for Tearne&#xa0;to take the names of most of&#xa0;her characters from Homer, and it obfuscates rather than illuminates her&#xa0;story. But her prose reflects the icy&#xa0;beauty of the snow: \u201cWe crossed the snaking bone of&#xa0;the river.\u201d And the&#xa0;novel is a thoughtful exploration of&#xa0;what it is&#xa0;to&#xa0;be a migrant and the child of migrants in a time of global&#xa0;crisis.</p> <p>\u2022 Natalie Haynes\u2019s <em>The Children of Jocasta</em> is published by Mantle.</p> <p><em>The White City </em>is published by Aardvark Bureau.

Now scientists have discovered what could be the subterranean rodents\u2019 strangest trait yet: they can survive without oxygen by switching to a metabolic strategy normally used by plants.</p> <p>By switching from a glucose-based metabolic system, which depends on oxygen, to one that uses fructose instead, mole rats can cope with nearly twenty minutes in air with 0% oxygen. Under the same conditions, a human would die within minutes.</p> <p>\u201cThe naked mole rat has simply rearranged some basic building-blocks of metabolism to make it super-tolerant to low oxygen conditions,\u201d said Thomas Park, professor of biological sciences at the University of Illinois at Chicago, who made the discovery after studying the species for 18 years.</p> <p>The apparently unique metabolic strategy probably evolved along with the mole rats\u2019 niche life-style, he said. The animals live in stuffy, hyper-crowded burrows, with chambers in which a hundred-odd colony mates sleep together in a heap of hairless bodies.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RildYBXele0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RildYBXele0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Scientists were aware that oxygen supplies in the mole rats\u2019 tunnels drop to levels that would be unsurvivable for other land mammals, but until now had not tested the limits of their ability to cope with oxygen deprivation, or how this works biologically.</p> <p>In the latest study, published in the journal <a href=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.aan1505\">Science</a>, the team found that mole rats showed no ill effects after five hours breathing air with 5% oxygen \u2013 slightly lower that oxygen levels at the summit of Everest. Laboratory mice, by contrast, died within ten minutes.</p> <p>In 0% oxygen, both the mice and mole rats quickly lost consciousness. But while the ordinary mice did not recover, the mole rats could survive in a state of suspended animation for more than 18 minutes.</p> <p>Although humans, such as free divers, can train themselves not to breathe for more than ten minutes, they only manage to do this by effectively bolstering their oxygen levels beforehand.</p> <p>\u201cIf you throw an ordinary person into 0%, it would be mere seconds or minutes,\u201d said Jane Reznick, Park\u2019s co-author, based at the Max Delbr\u00fcck Center of Molecular Medicine in Berlin.<br></p> <p>Grant McClelland, a biologist at McMaster University, Hamilton, who was not involved in the work, described the findings as extraordinary. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have predicted this ability for any mammal,\u201d he said. </p> <p>As oxygen levels dropped, the animals stopped moving, their beady eyes shut and their pulse and breathing dramatically slowed. Most curiously, though, metabolic tests revealed a sudden spike in the levels of fructose in their blood.</p> <p>\u201cWe were very surprised by this finding,\u201d said Reznick.</p> <p>The team discovered that instead of burning glucose to produce energy, the mole rats had switched to a fructose-based metabolic system, something only previously seen in plants.</p> <p>In aerobic metabolism, which the body normally relies on, the mitochondria (the cell\u2019s batteries) use broken-down glucose and oxygen to produce a molecule called ATP, which biologists call the cell\u2019s energy currency. When oxygen is in short supply, the body switches to anaerobic metabolism, where glucose is converted to ATP without oxygen. However, this conversion is about twenty times less efficient, and only ever serves as an emergency stop-gap because the production of lactic acid has an inhibitory effect on the process, causing the metabolism to grind to a halt.</p> <p>When mole rats switched to anaerobic metabolism, the scientists discovered, they started using fructose instead of glucose to make energy \u2013 and while this was still inefficient, energy production was steady.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little amount of energy, but a steady amount, that can keep it going,\u201d said Reznick.</p> <p>Understanding how the animals switch to an alternative metabolic pathway could lead to treatments for patients suffering crises of oxygen deprivation, as in heart attacks and strokes, the scientists said. They are now investigating whether human cells might have a dormant ability to do the same thing.</p> <p>Naked mole rats have fascinated scientists for decades. They can live more than 30 years, are cold-blooded, have a social hierarchy comparable to bees or ants, can run backwards and forward with equal ease, eat their own poo, can move their teeth individually like chopsticks and are one of the strangest looking creatures on the planet.<br></p> <p>So how does the latest finding rank among their odd social and physical traits?</p> <p>\u201cPretty highly,\u201d says McClelland. \u201cI\u2019d say joint top with resistance to cancer.\u201d</p>", "wordcount": "737"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "lifeandstyle/2017/jul/16/prescribe-youself-meadowsweet-a-horticulural-miracle-cure", "type": "article", "sectionId": "lifeandstyle", "sectionName": "Life and style", "webPublicationDate": "2017-07-16T05:47:45Z", "webTitle": "Prescribe yourself meadowsweet, a horticultural miracle cure", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jul/16/prescribe-youself-meadowsweet-a-horticulural-miracle-cure", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jul/16/prescribe-youself-meadowsweet-a-horticulural-miracle-cure", "fields": {"byline": "James Wong", "body": "<p>My gardening newbie mates often ask me for suggestions on what to grow in their gardens, usually with a wish list of features they\u2019d like the plant to have. Pretty flowers and low maintenance usually come right at the top of the list, followed by being scented, edible, good for wildlife and a British native. Finding a plant that fits all these criteria used to be a tough one for me until I discovered the wonders of meadowsweet (<em>Filipendula ulmaria</em>).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Imagine the fresh, floral aroma of elderflower but backed with deeper, richer almondy notes \u2013 like lychee meets marzipan</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>With a constant succession of frothy white flower plumes held high on graceful stems from May until the first frosts, there is no doubt that this native wildflower is super-attractive, and the bees certainly seem to agree. Its serrated apple-green leaves create neat weed-suppressing mats and the fresh, almondy scent of the blooms is surprisingly intense yet never cloying. On top of all of this the plants are about as tough as they come, needing little or no maintenance throughout the year if given the right spot.</p> <p>But to me all of these benefits pale in comparison with their flavour. Imagine the fresh, floral aroma of elderflower but backed with deeper, richer almondy notes \u2013 like lychee meets marzipan. Why it isn\u2019t a more popular dessert flavouring all over the world, I will never know. And this is before we add one final feature to the list: it is medicinal, too. Containing an aspirin-like compound, with pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory properties, meadowsweet tea was once an extremely common herbal medicine across the UK before aspirin was synthesised.</p> <p>To grow meadowsweet all you need is a spot in full sun with rich, moist soil. In the wild this plant grows in damp soils alongside canals and rivers, as well as water meadows in boggy and seasonally flooded ground. This makes them a great contender for normally problematic sites prone to waterlogging, yet in my experience it will also thrive in a regular garden border, even patio pots, if you keep up with the watering. All I do with mine each year is chop the growth down to about 20cm above ground level as they die down in the autumn to keep them neat.</p> <p>In the kitchen, meadowsweet can be used in all the same ways as its more common culinary cousin, elderflower. I like to infuse mine into hot milk or cream and use this as a base for custards, rice puddings, ice cream and panna cotta. But these flowers do contain aspirin-like compounds, if in a very dilute form, so do go easy with it. Perhaps not something to be eaten in excessive amounts or every day (no matter how delicious), and definitely something not for expecting mums, small kids or anyone allergic to aspirin.</p> <p>But for most of us it\u2019s a great excuse to have a tasty summer treat under a medicinal guise.</p> <p><em>Email James at <a href=\"mailto:james.wong@observer.co.uk\">james.wong@observer.co.uk</a> or follow him on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Botanygeek?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@Botanygeek</a></em></p>", "wordcount": "489"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}, {"id": "lifeandstyle/gardening-blog/2017/jun/08/blue-poppies-shine-at-gardening-scotland", "type": "article", "sectionId": "lifeandstyle", "sectionName": "Life and style", "webPublicationDate": "2017-06-08T12:55:07Z", "webTitle": "Blue poppies shine at Gardening Scotland", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gardening-blog/2017/jun/08/blue-poppies-shine-at-gardening-scotland", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/gardening-blog/2017/jun/08/blue-poppies-shine-at-gardening-scotland", "fields": {"byline": "Tom Smart", "body": "<p>The beginning of June is an important time for Scottish gardeners \u2013 the risk of frost has passed, early salads are ready for harvest, and flowers fill the borders.

From the Plant Village to the Floral Hall, the unusually vibrant blue of <a href=\"http://www.meconopsis.org/index.html\">meconopsis</a> was present. Meconopsis hails from the mist-clad hills of the Himalayas. It likes cool, damp summers and relatively mild winters. Scotland, therefore, is the perfect place to grow this beautiful blue flower.</p> <p>Recently, I was finally able to get <em><a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/69132/Meconopsis-baileyi/Details\">Meconopsis baileyi</a></em> to bloom in my garden. On a trip to the Isle of Arran last year, I picked up a small plant in a nursery at <a href=\"http://www.nts.org.uk/Visit/Brodick-Castle-and-Country-Park/\">Brodick Castle</a>. Arran is an island off the west coast of Scotland; warmed by the Gulf Stream, it is wet and mild - the perfect place to grow Meconopsis. Driving home, the small plant in the footwell of the car, we bounced along the small country roads. We boarded a ferry and arrived home. Planting our new arrival into the garden, taking the time to keep it moist and happy, has definitely been worth it. Few other colours can match the stunning shimmer of the blue poppy. It seemed everyone else at Gardening Scotland agreed.</p> <p><strong>Plant hunters and a murder mystery</strong></p> <p>This year the <a href=\"http:// http://www.gardeningscotland.com/show-gardens-2/\">show gardens</a> were spread out among greenhouse sellers and cappuccino vans. At previous shows, the show gardens were all clustered in one area, making comparisons and even locating them far easier.

The winner of best show garden was the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/thebotanics/posts/1551863068157364\">Chinese Hillside Garden</a>. Designed by Ruth Howell, a student at the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh, the garden was a celebration of rare and endangered plants. The plants included in the garden highlighted the work of people such as <a href=\"https://www.plantexplorers.com/explorers/biographies/forrest/george-forrest.htm\">George Forrest</a>, an Edwardian plant hunter who spent much of his life collecting plants in and around Yunnan province, China.</p> <p>The show garden was cut in diagonally by a bamboo bridge, with rocky faces rising on either side. The entire design replicated a rugged Chinese ravine. The planting featured many Chinese plants, including the now-ubiquitous rhododendron, along with the slightly more exotic giant <a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/3061/Cardiocrinum-giganteum/Details\">cardiocrinum</a>, the giant Himalayan lily. The entire garden was surrounded by high wooden walls, which echoed the safekeeping boxes used by the botanic gardens to store specimens. Like a wooden crate ready to be shipped back from China, this garden spoke of far flung corners of the world. My only wish was that those high wooden walls didn\u2019t block so much of the view of the garden. The path through the garden was roped off to visitors, and most of my interaction with the garden was limited to glimpses though a doorway.</p> <p>Another special garden this year, and by far my favourite garden, was the <a href=\"https://cultivate.sruc.ac.uk/gold-hortus-homicida/\">Hortus Homicida</a> garden developed by second year students at <a href=\"https://www.sruc.ac.uk/\">Scotland\u2019s Rural College</a>. The garden reimagined the murder of Lord Darnley, the husband of Mary Queen of Scots. The events of his death in 1567 near Edinburgh are surrounded in mystery \u2013 his body was found outside his lodging with no noticeable wounds. All that was left at the scene was an upturned chair, a cloak, and a dagger. The show garden itself featured an old stone wall enclosing a wildflower meadow. Ancient looking pear trees made the garden feel established and provided structure. Of course, at the centre of the garden, hidden in the grass among poppies, was an upturned chair; nearby was the dagger and the cloak. It was a romantic yet eerie garden and one of the highlights of the show.</p> <p><strong>Pallet gardens and sand pits</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ad25e9473f0c4fe4a11db505be9d0559e9303446\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad25e9473f0c4fe4a11db505be9d0559e9303446/0_63_1438_1797/800.jpg\" alt=\"The Bee Kind Bee Happy Garden by Law Primary School, North Berwick\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018An explosion of yellow wrapped with black stripes.\u2019 The Bee Kind, Bee Happy pallet garden by Law Primary school.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Smart</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gardening Scotland is always a family-friendly affair.

The <a href=\"http://www.gardeningscotland.com/the-big-back-garden/\">Big Back Garden</a> had lots to keep the little ones happy while mum or dad nipped off to check out the plant sales: bouncy castles (of course), sand pits, a story telling tent, animals, and ice cream, the event organisers seemed to realise that flowers aren\u2019t the only thing that makes a good day out.</p> <p>This year, like last, we brought a picnic to keep costs down. The event seems to encourage people to bring their own food and drink. Wandering into the beer tent, I noticed that people were filling up the tables and taking out their own snacks and sandwiches. Instead of shooing away people like obnoxious flies, the staff didn\u2019t seem to mind. There were no nasty faces or signs reading, \u201cOnly food and drink purchased on the premises may be consumed\u201d. I liked that.</p> <p>The Big Back Garden also featured pallet gardens: mini-gardens that can only fill a space the size of a pallet. Most the entries were from local primary schools. My favourite, and the winner of a gold medal, was the Bee Kind, Bee Happy Garden by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lawps?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Law Primary School, North Berwick</a>. It was an explosion of yellow wrapped with black stripes. All the plants were chosen for their appeal to pollinators and to highlight the need to protect our bees.</p> <p><strong>\u2018We swap cider for apples\u2019</strong></p> <p>This year there was a real emphasis on food in the floral hall. There was definitely an effort to connect the process of growing, to the art of cooking. There is a natural link between the two, and while I wouldn\u2019t want Gardening Scotland to turn into a food festival, it was a nice distraction. I especially appreciated the sign which read, \u201cWe swap cider for apples\u201d next to a stall promoting <a href=\"http://www.scottishfruittrees.com/Scottish_Fruit_Trees/Welcome.html\">Scottish heritage fruit trees</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cadd919907348278272b66a10a371187755a322b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cadd919907348278272b66a10a371187755a322b/0_387_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rococo Gardens display at Gardening Scotland 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gunneras and rodgersias featured alongside dinosaurs on the Rococo Gardens display.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Smart</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There was also a great display by <a href=\"http://www.rococo-gardens.co.uk/\">Rococo Gardens</a> inspired by prehistoric Scotland.

Watching how people were drawn to the plant, how they admired its furry leaves and petals the colour of the Aegean Sea, I could see why it was such a hit this year. While we might moan about the incessant rain in Scotland, at least our climate allows us to grow this truly special plant.

Seen like that, experts warn, humanity is currently \u201c<a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fevo.2017.00175/full#h6\">burning the library of life</a>\u201d. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1352e28a468bd2be79015cb3a357be116a088e2f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1352e28a468bd2be79015cb3a357be116a088e2f/215_23_2050_648/1000.png\" alt=\"Bugs illustration\" width=\"1000\" height=\"316\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bugs are the base of the many wild food chains that support ecosystems.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Frances Marriott</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Do animals and bugs really matter to me?</strong></p> <p>For many people living in towns and cities, wildlife is often something you watch on television. But the reality is that the air you breathe, the water you drink and the food you eat all ultimately rely on biodiversity. Some examples are obvious: without plants there would be no oxygen and without bees to pollinate there would be no fruit or nuts. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/article-embeds/Sidebar/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Sidebare 1\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/article-embeds/Sidebar/embed.html\">Sidebare 1</a> </figure>  <p>Others are less obvious \u2013 coral reefs and mangrove swamps provide invaluable protection from cyclones and tsunamis for those living on coasts, while trees can absorb air pollution in urban areas. </p> <p>Others appear bizarre \u2013 tropical tortoises and spider monkeys seemingly have little to do with maintaining a stable climate. But the dense, hardwood trees that are most effective in removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere rely on their seeds being dispersed by these large fruit-eaters.</p> <p>When scientists explore each ecosystem, they find countless such interactions, all honed by millions of years of evolution. If undamaged, this produces a finely balanced, healthy system which contributes to a healthy sustainable planet. </p> <p>The sheer richness of biodiversity also has human benefits. Many new medicines are harvested from nature, such as a fungi that grows on the fur of sloths and can fight cancer. Wild varieties of domesticated animals and crops are also crucial as some will have already solved the challenge of, for example, coping with drought or salty soils.</p> <p>If money is a measure, the services provided by ecosystems are estimated to be worth trillions of dollars \u2013 double the world\u2019s GDP. Biodiversity loss in Europe alone costs the continent about 3% of its GDP, or \u20ac450m (\u00a3400m), a year. </p> <p>From an aesthetic point of view, every one of the millions of species is unique, a natural work of art that cannot be recreated once lost. \u201cEach higher organism is richer in information than a Caravaggio painting, a Bach fugue, or any other great work,\u201d wrote Prof Edward O Wilson, often called the \u201cfather of biodiversity\u201d, in a <a href=\"https://liberiafti.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/wilson_biological-diversity-crisis.pdf\">seminal paper in 1985</a>. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"4fc2361f0772ac59b91df34ce8434438af47e199\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4fc2361f0772ac59b91df34ce8434438af47e199/0_0_1680_2188/768.png\" alt=\"Insect illustration\" width=\"768\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">75% of flying insects were lost in the last 25 years in Germany, according to a recent study.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Frances Marriott</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Just how diverse is biodiversity?</strong></p> <p>Mind-bogglingly diverse. The simplest aspect to consider is species. About 1.7 million species of animals, plants and fungi have been recorded, but there are likely to be 8-9 million and possibly up to 100 million. The heartland of biodiversity is the tropics, which teems with species. In 15 hectares (37 acres) of Borneo forest, for example, there are 700 species of tree \u2013 the same number as the whole of North America.</p> <p>Recent work considering diversity at a genetic level has suggested that creatures thought to be a single species could in some cases actually be dozens. Then add in bacteria and viruses, and the number of distinct organisms may well be in the billions. A single spoonful of soil \u2013 which ultimately provides 90% of all food \u2013 contains 10,000 to 50,000 different types of bacteria.</p> <p>The concern is that many species are being lost before we are even aware of them, or the role they play in the circle of life. </p> <p><strong>How bad is it?</strong></p> <p>Very. The best studied creatures are the ones like us \u2013 large mammals. Tiger numbers, for example, have plunged by 97% in the last century. In many places, bigger animals have already been wiped out by humans \u2013 think dodos or woolly mammoths. </p> <p>The extinction rate of species is now thought to be about <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn25645-we-are-killing-species-at-1000-times-the-natural-rate/\">1,000 times higher</a> than before humans dominated the planet, which may be even faster than the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2006/may/02/biodiversity.conservationandendangeredspecies\">losses after a giant meteorite wiped out the dinosaurs</a> 65m years ago. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/10/earths-sixth-mass-extinction-event-already-underway-scientists-warn\">sixth mass extinction in geological history has already begun</a>, according to some scientists.</p> <p>Lack of data means <a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/\">the \u201cred list</a>\u201d, produced by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, has only assessed 5% of known species. But for the best known groups it finds <a href=\"https://www.iucn.org/theme/species/our-work/iucn-red-list-threatened-species\">many are threatened</a>: 25% of mammals, 41% of amphibians and 13% of birds.</p> <p>Species extinction provides a clear but narrow window on the destruction of biodiversity \u2013 it is the disappearance of the last member of a group that is by definition rare. But new studies are examining the drop in the total number of animals, capturing the plight of the world\u2019s most common creatures.</p> <p>The results are scary. Billions of individual populations have been lost all over the planet, with the number of animals living on Earth having <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/29/earth-lost-50-wildlife-in-40-years-wwf\">plunged by half since 1970</a>.

Changes to the climate are reversible, even if that takes centuries or millennia. But once species become extinct, particularly those unknown to science, there\u2019s no going back. </p> <p>At the moment, we don\u2019t know how much biodiversity the planet can lose without prompting widespread ecological collapse. But one approach has assessed so-called \u201c<a href=\"http://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/planetary-boundaries/planetary-boundaries/about-the-research/the-nine-planetary-boundaries.html\">planetary boundaries</a>\u201d, thresholds in Earth systems that define a \u201csafe operating space for humanity\u201d. Of the nine considered, just biodiversity loss and nitrogen pollution are estimated to have been crossed, unlike CO2 levels, freshwater used and ozone losses. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1b0de75d740ce8436e3f1174a24e0c51088625f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b0de75d740ce8436e3f1174a24e0c51088625f4/0_0_1609_3000/536.png\" alt=\"Cow illustration\" width=\"536\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">By weight, 97% of the world\u2019s vertebrate land animals are humans or their livestock \u2013 just 3% are thought to be wild.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Frances Marriott</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>What can be done?</strong></p> <p>Giving nature the space and protection it needs is the only answer. Wildlife reserves are the obvious solution, and the world currently protects 15% of land and 7% of the oceans. But some argue that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/18/should-we-give-half-planet-earth-wildlife-nature-reserve\">half the land surface</a> must be set aside for nature.</p> <p>However, the human population is rising and wildlife reserves don\u2019t work if they hinder local people making a living. The poaching crisis for elephants and rhinos in Africa is an extreme example. Making the animals worth more alive than dead is the key, for example by supporting tourism or compensating farmers for livestock killed by wild predators.</p> <p>But it can lead to tough choices. \u201cTrophy hunting\u201d for big game is anathema for many. But if the shoots are done sustainably \u2013 only killing old lions, for example \u2013 and the money raised protects a large swath of land, should it be permitted? </p> <p>We can all help. Most wildlife is destroyed by land being cleared for cattle, soy, palm oil, timber and leather. Most of us consume these products every day, with palm oil being found in many foods and toiletries. Choosing only sustainable options helps, as does eating less meat, particularly beef, which has an outsized environmental hoofprint.</p> <p>Another approach is to highlight the value of biodiversity by estimating the financial value of the ecosystem services provided as \u201cnatural capital\u201d. Sometimes this can lead to real savings. Over the last 20 years, <a href=\"https://www.amny.com/opinion/columnists/mark-chiusano/the-deal-that-keeps-new-york-s-water-safe-to-drink-1.16880113\">New York has spent $2bn protecting the natural watershed</a> that supplies the city with clean water. It has worked so well that 90% of the water needs no further filtering: building a water treatment plant instead would have cost $10bn. </p> <p><strong>What\u2019s next?</strong></p> <p>Locating the tipping point that moves biodiversity loss into ecological collapse is an urgent priority. Biodiversity is vast and research funds are small, but speeding up analysis might help, from automatically <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/ai-plant-and-animal-identification-helps-us-all-be-citizen-scientists-180963525/\">identifying creatures using machine learning</a> to <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-08461-5\">real-time DNA sequencing</a>. </p> <p>There is even an initiative that aims to create an <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/press/2018/01/new-partnership-aims-to-sequence-genomes-of-all-life-on-earth-unlock-nature-s-value-tackle-bio-piracy-and-habitat-loss/\">open-source genetic database for all plants, animals and single-cell organisms</a> on the planet. It argues that by creating commercial opportunities \u2013 such as self-driving car algorithms inspired by Amazonian ants \u2013 it could provide the incentive to preserve Earth\u2019s biodiversity.</p> <p>However, some researchers say the dire state of biodiversity is already clear enough and that the missing ingredient is political will.</p> <p>A global treaty, the <a href=\"https://www.cbd.int/\">Convention on Biological Diversity</a> (CBD), has set many targets. Some are likely to be reached, for example protecting 17% of all land and 10% of the oceans by 2020. Others, such as making all fishing sustainable by the same date are not. The 196 nations that are members of the CBD next meet in Egypt in November.</p> <p>In his 1985 text, Prof E O Wilson, concluded: \u201cThis being the only living world we are ever likely to know, let us join to make the most of it.\u201d That call is more urgent than ever.</p> <p><strong>Further reading</strong></p> <p><em><a href=\"https://liberiafti.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/wilson_biological-diversity-crisis.pdf\">The Biological Diversity Crisis</a> (1985).

Ratinon, from Surrey, started volunteering, picking tomatoes and getting sunburnt. It sowed the seed of something: \u201cIt was the calmest, cleanest place in the city and somewhere my soul was saying, this is where you need to spend more time.\u201d</p> <p>Brooklyn Grange appeared at the right time in Ratinon\u2019s life. After three years living in the US, she had begun to question what she was eating. The urban farm, where everything is grown organically, showed Ratinon a different way of food production. She took time off work and spent several months there with other apprentices, learning how to grow crops organically, before moving back to London in late 2014. There, she sought out growing communities and trained as a patchwork farmer at the Hackney-based social enterprise Growing Communities \u2013 growing salads at one of nine small market gardens \u2013 and as a beekeeper and gardener at the <a href=\"http://beefriendlytrust.org/\">Bee Friendly Trust </a>charity.

Your whole practice is about working with nature and enriching the environment at the same time as feeding people. I feel very passionate about that.\u201d In the meantime, she is spending the summer on an organic farm in Wiltshire, harvesting asparagus. Ratinon is also drawn to the therapeutic potential in urban farming. \u201cWhen I walk into an urban growing space there\u2019s a sense of relief,\u201d she says. \u201cThey feel like some of the safest, most beautiful spaces I\u2019ve been into.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Favourite plant</strong> Tomatoes.

His late mother was a gardener, the family patch part of the <a href=\"https://www.ngs.org.uk/\">National Garden Scheme</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s just there,\u201d he says of the desire to dig. \u201cYou suddenly want to be outside, you have a sense of pride and ownership.\u201d So he worked at a local nursery during school holidays and visited Chelsea with his grandparents. (\u201cI was in awe,\u201d he says.) He went to plant fairs, collected pelargoniums, and at 16, began studies in horticulture at Pershore College, Worcestershire.</p> <p>It was Hoyle\u2019s first gardening job, age 11 at a local 17th-century manor house, that settled the matter. \u201cThat got me going; at first it was mowing grass, clearing up fallen fruit and squashing lily beetles,\u201d Hoyle says. \u201cThe vicar used to pay me 20p a beetle. I had small hands that caught them quickly.\u201d</p> <p>After completing his first horticultural course, Hoyle spent two years working at Aberglasney Gardens in Carmarthenshire, west Wales. The head gardener was Kew-trained and encouraged Hoyle to take up further study. He studied the Kew Diploma for three years before securing a permanent position there, helping to manage the Rose Garden, the Great Broad Walk Borders, Palm House pond and Victoria Gate entrance. These are some of Kew\u2019s choicest spots, which Hoyle shows off to his online following.</p> <p>Hoyle\u2019s passion has taken him around the world.

Richards\u2019 family live on an 11-acre holding near Aberystwyth in Wales, where from a young age he would help his father sow seeds in the vegetable garden. At 12, out of boredom, Richards started making videos. Not everyone was on board in the beginning. \u201cMy friends were like, \u2018Why are you doing that? It\u2019s so weird,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cBecause stereotypically you\u2019d see a teenage boy doing something [online] about gaming or sport.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The average age of gardening presenters and writers is a lot older \u2013 I\u2019ve been doing this by myself and had 20m views</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Richards built his social media profile while boarding on scholarship at Llandovery College. A head boy there, he gardened, filmed and edited in his spare time (he\u2019s produced more than 400 videos). He was awarded a \u00a35,000 grant to promote sustainable food, won a national young entrepreneur award and made \u00a312,000 by his 18th birthday. He listens to the podcasts of entrepreneurial self-help guru Gary Vaynerchuk while in the garden. \u201cGary\u2019s been the biggest influence in my life,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s very strategic and tries to push positivity.

Both run individual, award-winning garden design practices, but also collaborate on show gardens. In 2017, they pooled their talents for a BBC Radio 2 Feel Good Garden at Chelsea; this year they are back to create an artisan garden for a craft gin company. \u201cArchitects work together in big practices so why should it be different with garden designers?\u201d says Bristol-based Savill.</p> <p>The pair met in competition at RHS Tatton Park flower show in 2015 where they were both up for Young Designer of the Year. Bridge won, and Savill was awarded a gold medal \u2013 not bad for her first show garden. The two hit it off when they spent three weeks living side by side in a camper van (Bridge) and a tent (Savill) at the show. \u201cIt started off just Tamara and me in a field, two girls cracking on for weeks,\u201d says Savill.</p> <p>Collaborating has been a great creative experience, says Bridge, whose practice is based in Norfolk. \u201cPartnerships can be seen as quite a sparky relationship, but we are the opposite, we get calmer.\u201d They consult each other on their individual projects and say working together only adds to the sum of the work, even if Savill tends to have the final tweak.</p> <p>\u201cKate waits till I\u2019ve gone off site,\u201d Bridge laughs. \u201cI get quite stressed about changing things on site so she\u2019ll wait until I\u2019ve gone and sneak in.\u201d In her defence, Savill always makes her partner aware of the alterations.</p> <p>For their Chelsea show, Bridge and Savill are heading a team of 22, which splits squarely on gender lines: the construction side is exclusively male, the planters mostly women. The construction team gets paid first and the planters only if budget allows. The women, therefore, tend to be volunteers. It\u2019s accepted practice generally, say Bridge and Savill, but it\u2019s beginning to get their goat. \u201cWhy is it acceptable for a project to run like that?\u201d says Bridge. \u201cThe next time we do this it\u2019s at the top of our list of things that won\u2019t happen. It does make me quite cross.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Favourite plant </strong>Bridge: I love a wild strawberry. Chives are great because the flower is edible and you can pull it off and sprinkle it on your salad for a spring onion taste.</p> <p><strong>Hates</strong> Bridge: bad lawn edges. I like a nice crisp edge with no tufty bits. If you have a flowerbed with an edge on the lawn, it needs to be neat and tidy.</p> <p><strong>Next big thing</strong> Savill: crazy paving is making a big wave at the moment.</p> <h2>The environmental estate gardener</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"31605733fc50f1d613ca27c611edbcf3b149db27\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31605733fc50f1d613ca27c611edbcf3b149db27/0_742_3000_3750/800.jpg\" alt=\"Lachlan Rae\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018You walk out of the door and you\u2019re at your work.

It\u2019s a nice way to live.\u2019</p> <p>Working alone or with his wife, Sian, Rae insists on traditional horticultural practices where possible. \u201cI like to think of myself as an arts and crafts gardener. There\u2019s no automated watering, it\u2019s all watering cans. Instead of using plastic canes everywhere, I cut hazel twigs up in the woods and use that for staking plants to keep the environmental footprint down.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Gardening is just seen as pushing a wheelbarrow about all day; it\u2019s seen as a career for the no-hopers</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Rae left school at 16 and took seasonal work as a Christmas tree cutter and then a self-employed gardener, where his lack of expertise exasperated him. \u201cPeople were asking me questions I couldn\u2019t answer.\u201d After taking a local gardening course he enrolled on the horticulture with plantsmanship course at the Royal Botanical Garden, Edinburgh. The academic grounding helped Rae win last year\u2019s Young Horticulturalist of the Year, a national competition run by the Institute of Horticulture which tests the scholarly mettle of gardeners under 30 across categories that include horticultural science and practice plus plant, pest and weed identification.</p> <p>These wider aspects of gardening often go overlooked, says Rae. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more to horticulture than just gardening; there\u2019s a lot of science and it\u2019s artistic,\u201d he says. \u2018I don\u2019t know that the message is out there about the range of jobs. Gardening is just seen as pushing a wheelbarrow about all day. Schools are at fault; it\u2019s seen as a career for the no-hopers.\u201d</p> <p>Rae moves to a new role this month as head gardener on Wiston Estate, in West Sussex. He will be in charge of a four-person team, all under 25, that will maintain 17 acres of public gardens. \u201cIt\u2019s just what I need, a new challenge.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Favourite plant</strong> <a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/3415/Cercidiphyllum-japonicum/Details\"><em>Cercidiphyllum japonicum</em></a>, also known as the katsura tree.

Stepping into one should feel like a holiday from life. \u201cWhen I design someone\u2019s garden, it\u2019s important to look at what inspires them and what kind of environment they feel happiest in,\u201d says the 25-year-old RHS Young Designer of the Year 2017. \u201cPeople draw from their experiences of being on holiday or from their childhood, time spent in nature. A lot of my work is an interpretation of that happy place in the garden.\u201d</p> <p>Bujauskaite\u2019s award-winning garden, <a href=\"https://www.shedworking.co.uk/2017/07/studio-unwired-at-rhs-tatton.html\">Studio Unwired</a> \u2013 shown at last year\u2019s RHS Tatton Park flower show \u2013 drew inspiration from her own happy place, the Baltic coastline of her childhood. She created an outdoor working space informed by the earthy, serene summers of the Lithuanian seaside.</p> <p>Bujauskaite knew from childhood that she wanted to pursue design. She attended the Fine Arts School in Lithuania from age 12 until her family moved to Northampton in 2008, and she took a 3D design course in Milton Keynes followed by one in Landscape Architecture at Birmingham City University. There she was awarded the Landscape Institute\u2019s John Knight award twice, for degree and master\u2019s projects.</p> <p>The personal connections in Bujauskaite\u2019s work first surfaced here; her master\u2019s explored the benefits of garden spaces for patients in palliative care. \u201cI was 17 when my mum passed away from cancer. I had to spend a lot of time in a hospice with her and I wished there was a garden to walk out into and just spend some time in,\u201d she says. The therapeutic aspects of colour, texture and how a garden view can offer relief to patients are elements Bujauskaite would like to touch on again in future work. \u201cA garden can change people\u2019s experience of going through something sad or horrible,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Bujauskaite, who combines her own work with freelancing for other studios and illustration, is preparing a Lifestyle garden for this year\u2019s RHS Hampton Court Palace flower show \u2013 a new category for female designers under 30, to mark 100 years since women won the right to vote. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing now that we [women] get encouraged to be in the construction and design industries,\u201d she says. \u201cSometimes approaching the build managers and contractors could be quite a daunting experience. So when you\u2019re being spoken of or heard of, people feel like they have more trust in you.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Favourite plant</strong> Grasses: at sales, people pick the bright colours and all the grasses are left behind, which I love most.</p> <p><strong>Grow now</strong> If you live in a flat, grow herbs like rosemary or mint or anything flowering that would enliven the space.</p> <p><strong>Next big thing</strong> Wabi-sabi, from Japanese culture, is seeing beauty in imperfection.

At 16, having left school, he got a job with a local landscape gardener in Sussex. The 5.30am start and 12-hour working days were a steep learning curve. \u201cIt matured me very quickly,\u201d he says. \u201cI remember a lorry dumped four tonnes of sand at the front of a terraced house. I was passed a spade and a bucket and told to get all the sand round the back. That was a long day.\u201d</p> <p>He has advanced remarkably quickly since. His passion for gardening deepening, he took a local course near his family home in Sussex. At 18, having saved half the fees, with the remainder paid by his parents, Williams became the youngest diploma student at <a href=\"https://www.lcgd.org.uk/\">London College of Garden Design</a>. He went it alone after graduating, specialising in residential garden design, freelancing for his \u201cbread and butter\u201d, then winning projects against industry veterans. \u201cI had nothing to risk, and in five years\u2019 time I probably would have, so it was the perfect time to show the industry what I\u2019ve got at quite an early age by myself,\u201d Williams says.</p> <p>Show gardens helped Williams\u2019 star rise. A triple RHS gold medallist, his 2016 garden at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/hampton-court-palace-flower-show\">Hampton Court Palace flower show</a> celebrated the South Downs with flint sculptures, Sussex clay bricks and the local round-headed <a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/41753/Campanula-rapunculus/Details\">rampion</a> flower. He returned to Hampton Court in 2017 with a markedly different project; a large-scale reproduction of the natural defences installed in the flood blackspot of Pickering in Yorkshire. \u201cIt was [about] how protection can work in some locations around the UK,\u201d he says. \u201cIt costs a lot less, is more aesthetically pleasing and is less damaging to the environment.\u201d</p> <p>Williams\u2019 next show sees him up for the <a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/shows-events/rhs-flower-show-tatton-park/News/2018/young-designer-applications\">RHS Young Designer of the Year 2018</a> (the winners are announced in July). At One is a show garden about balance, pleasing to humans and attractive to bees, butterflies and bugs. His ultimate ambition is a main avenue garden at Chelsea flower show. And while he is still young (a landscaper once refused to work with him because he looked so fresh-faced), Williams believes starting so early has been to his advantage. \u201cLots of people are career changers so they might not have as much experience as I do,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is all I have really known from the age of 16. My youth hasn\u2019t stopped me yet.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Favourite plant</strong> The <a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/details?plantid=116\">amelanchier</a> tree.

With the Invicta Sailing Club, he sailed the length of the Thames and round to Dover and from Dover to the Netherlands.</p> <p>John became known to many people as a leader of natural history walks in Kent, initially through Hilderstone adult education centre in Thanet, later for Canterbury Adult Education and Canterbury University School of Continuing Education. Starting in 1981, he led up to three groups per week in the summer months, and two groups throughout the year for over 25 years. When he retired, the groups continued and invited John as their guest.</p> <p>Through John, many learned about plants and animals and corners of their county which they had not known to exist. He estimated that he had walked more than 25,000 miles leading gzroups in east Kent alone. His courses were always oversubscribed, because of his encyclopedic knowledge and easy manner of communication. No topic was too obscure for him: he enthused everyone by turning an educational experience into a social event.</p> <p>John was the son of Alan Weavers and Adrienne Loveri: his father was a flight engineer for BOAC. John was born in Enfield, north London, but the family moved to Feltham when he was two years old. Later they moved again, to Goring-by-Sea, West Sussex, and he attended Worthing high school for boys. He started his training as a maths teacher in 1965 at Christchurch College Canterbury (now Canterbury Christ Church University), where he met Frankie Harman, whom he married in 1969. In the same year he started teaching in schools in east Kent.</p> <p>A true friend of nature, he wanted people to share his joy in being outdoors in all seasons and demonstrate the importance of conserving our wild places.

Inside, there\u2019s a profusion of what almost resemble rooms: rough meadows of long grass, glades sheltered by sallow clumps, reed-filled ditches and huge, dark circles of asphalt.</p> <p>Canvey Wick was once flat, green grazing marshes, rather like <a href=\"http://www.rspb.org.uk/reserves-and-events/find-a-reserve/reserves-a-z/reserves-by-name/w/westcanveymarsh/index.aspx\">West Canvey marsh</a>, a conventional RSPB reserve up the road. Then humans wrecked the place \u2013 and in doing so turned it into something much more marvellous. It was used as a dumping ground for sediment extracted from the Thames, so the meadows were covered with gravel, sand, chalk and fragments of old shells. In the 1970s, the ground was prepared for an oil refinery; 13 circular pads of asphalt are the foundations for huge, cylindrical tanks. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/06/what-1973-today-economic-crisis\">the oil price crash of 1973</a> meant the refinery was abandoned before it opened.</p> <p>This history has created a wide variety of soil types and habitats in a small space. It is more like a savannah than a rainforest: hot and sunny, not swamped by dark trees. Ecologists call this \u201copen mosaic habitat\u201d. I put my hand close to the crumbling asphalt; even on a cool day, the surface is warm. Reptiles \u2013 such as slowworms and common lizards \u2013 thrive in such conditions, as do rare insects. Newly arriving species from the continent enjoy the estuary\u2019s low rainfall, too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74444dc7cb3d3ac7e5510b4e8ea25ad6ea44de06\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74444dc7cb3d3ac7e5510b4e8ea25ad6ea44de06/0_120_3800_2280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Asphalt pad for oil refinery at Canvey Wick\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It was used as a dumping ground for sediment extracted from the Thames\u2019 ... an asphalt pad built for the ill-fated oil refinery at Canvey Wick.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The first insect to land on me is a mosquito. Not a good start. Next, we stroll through the meadows and carefully lift a small square of black roofing felt that has been (deliberately) left on the ground. \u201cBombardier beetles hide under things like this,\u201d explains Earwaker. These striking beetles, which have metallic, blue-green wing cases, detonate an explosion inside their abdomen if disturbed, spraying hot liquid at attackers, whether insect or human.</p> <p>We don\u2019t find any bombardiers, but Earwaker detects a flying insect and, with a decisive swish of the net she\u2019s carrying, catches one of Britain\u2019s 5,000-plus species of parasitic wasp. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this is a new species,\u201d she says. It is black and spindly, with four bright-orange front legs and two black rear legs. Often rare and beautiful, parasitic wasps do no harm to humans, but skilfully parasitise other insects.</p> <p>Autumnal Canvey Wick is surprisingly floral. There\u2019s a great deal of <a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/159630/Lotus-glaber/Details?returnurl=%2Fplants%2Fsearch-results%3Fcontext%3Db%25253D245900%252526hf%25253D10%252526l%25253Den%252526s%25253Ddesc%25252528plant_merged%25252529%252526sl%25253Dplants%26s%3Ddesc(plant_merged)%26form-mode%3Dfalse%26page%3D24592%26aliaspath%3D%252fplants%252fsearch-results\">narrow-leaved bird\u2019s foot trefoil</a> underfoot, plus clumps of sea aster, a mauve, daisy-like plant that is the sole food of the <a href=\"https://www.buglife.org.uk/sea-aster-mining-bee\">sea aster mining bee</a>.

We scour a patch and spot a dainty bumblebee. It has a dusting of primrose-yellow colour and a distinctive square of black on its thorax: it is the shrill carder bee. This extremely rare bee doesn\u2019t forage far from the nest, so it needs nearby flowers and, crucially, late-flowering plants. Unusually for a bumblebee, it can still be seen in mid-October, when its queens require nectar to survive. Earwaker beckons me to listen to their buzzing. \u201cThey really do have a high-pitched buzz, which you can get a feel for, which explains their name,\u201d she says.</p> <p>A green woodpecker cackles in the trees and a ship \u2013 larger than I expected \u2013 slips up the Thames, just the other side of the sea wall. A sand hill is covered with miniature volcanoes, made by the hairy-legged mining bee, also called the pantaloon bee. Hairs on the females\u2019 hind legs help collect pollen and really do make them look like they are wearing baggy trousers.</p> <p>Many insects are disappearing by autumn, hunkering down for the winter, but we still see the last <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/29/meadow-brown-butterfly-survival-country-diary\">meadow browns</a> of the year, a <a href=\"http://www.wildlifetrusts.org/species/silver-y\">silver Y moth</a> and a brown-banded carder bee.

Summer days are also when the bee wolf strikes, a wasp that pounces like a raptor on honeybees.</p> <p>Canvey Wick is at its most atmospheric in autumn and winter, though. This hybrid edgeland, which blends the gorgeous bubbling call of curlew with the beeping of a reversing lorry, is replete with surprises. It is a hopeful place, too, showing how nature bounces back \u2013 and how we sometimes possess the vision to protect it.</p> <p><em>You can find Canvey Wick next to the cemetery at Northwick Road, Canvey Island, SS8 0PT.

But what\u2019s causing the butterflies to vanish from cities? </p> <p>The first and most easily understood cause is habitat loss. Green cities are becoming grey. The number of front gardens totally paved over has tripled from <a href=\"http://www.lowimpact.org/3-million-front-gardens-have-been-completely-paved-since-2005-lets-try-to-reverse-this-trend/\">1.5 million to 4.59 million</a> between 2005 and 2015, according to the Royal Horticultural Society. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jun/08/london-gardens-parks-paved\">London survey</a> found that the capital is losing the equivalent of two-and-a-half Hyde Parks of greenery a year from its domestic gardens \u2013 about 3,000ha (7,410 acres).

But there\u2019s no simple, single cause, according to the co-author of the joint study by Butterfly Conservation, Kent university and the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology. \u201cThere are a lot of different factors. Paving over gardens is definitely a problem but it\u2019s not the only one and probably not the biggest either,\u201d says Prof Tom Brereton of Butterfly Conservation.</p> <p>Many larger gardens have been divided up and built on in recent years, and changing garden fashions are reducing the butterfly-friendly habitat. \u201cGenerally there\u2019s more artificial space now in your average garden with decking and barbecue areas,\u201d says Brereton, who points out that gardeners also use more pesticides per area than farmers.</p> <p>More widely, brownfield sites - an area of land previously used or built upon, which are some of the best insect habitats - are increasingly targeted for development. Austerity has meant that local councils\u2019 contractors scalp verges and green areas once or twice a year, destroying wildflowers and the insects that depend on them.</p> <p>\u201cRiver banks and roadsides are just cut down to a bowling green as efficiently as possible to save money. You\u2019d think all the messages about wildlife verges would have got through, but it still hasn\u2019t really,\u201d says Brereton. \u201cCountryside services that local authorities provide have collapsed in some areas and been drastically reduced in others.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"97ae13b3f4783ec07e3f23442ebcdadeb0828e4e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97ae13b3f4783ec07e3f23442ebcdadeb0828e4e/0_156_5574_3344/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Red Admiral\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Red admiral butterflies are seen more frequently in cities than other species.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Derek Harris/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This loss and fragmentation of habitat particularly affects insects that aren\u2019t as strong fliers and are less able to find new sources of food, such as the small heath and small copper. (The powerful flying red admiral\u2019s urban decline has been less pronounced than other species.)</p> <p>Brereton cites two other major factors which are causing urban butterflies to disappear. Climate change appears to be exacerbated by the urban heat island effect in towns and cities, and so butterfly species struggle to adapt to warmer winters \u2013 a common problem for a number of British species \u2013 are finding it even harder in urban spaces.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Right through Brighton there\u2019s as much diversity as you\u2019ll find on the remotest downland valley</p> <footer> <cite>Michael Blencowe</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Finally, the impact of pollution, particularly from diesel-powered vehicles, is unknown but may be more significant than scientists suspect. The sheer volume of traffic is leading to higher nitrogen deposition, which has been linked to butterfly declines in the Netherlands. Researchers found that it led to a decline in plants that prefer less fertile soils. The butterflies suffering the biggest UK declines, the small copper and small heath, both prefer plants that grow in low-fertility soil. Nitrogen deposition also reduces the quality of plants. In effect, said the Dutch scientists, it turns plants into junk food for insects.</p> <p>Butterfly Conservation is now refocusing its efforts on towns and wants the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) to adopt the annual urban butterfly data as an indicator of environmental health, and act to stop further declines. \u201cWe want to do more for butterflies in urban areas,\u201d says Brereton. \u201cWe\u2019re looking to develop more urban projects and engage more people.\u201d</p> <p>Some cities are already engaged \u2013 and some urban areas even offer better butterfly-watching than the surrounding countryside.

Nine years ago, he created a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/may/16/butterfly-revival-threatened-by-cuts\">\u201cbutterfly haven\u201d</a> in the grounds of Dorothy Stringer High School \u2013 exposing the chalk beneath the standard lushly grassed playing fields and getting pupils to plant wild flowers.

What the satellite pictures won\u2019t show are the rare Adonis blues and silver-spotted skippers which fly on the site \u2013 two species which were so rare in the 1980s it was feared they would go extinct.</p> <p>According to Danahar, it doesn\u2019t cost a council much to create such havens: \u201cGet one of your guys with a bulldozer to scrape the turf off the chalk and put some local wild flower plugs in \u2013 the kids put them in, and it\u2019s a whole community-wide engagement.\u201d Danahar will soon create a new haven on a steep piece of Brighton seafront. He plans to plant nectar and food plants for migratory insects such as broadleaved everlasting pea \u2013 the foodplant of the long-tailed blue. \u201cThink of the ecotourism potential \u2013 people travel from Scotland to see this butterfly,\u201d he says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/jun/14/nature-europe-urban-protected-area-vacaresti-nature-park-romania\">How nature turned a failed communist plan into Bucharest's unique urban park</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In 2014, Brighton was made a <a href=\"http://www.thelivingcoast.org.uk/\">Unesco World Biosphere</a>, a conservation designation which helps protect its important chalk grassland, shingle beaches and undersea chalk reefs.

Has this local political focus benefitted butterflies?</p> <p>\u201cI think it has. The whole biosphere designation has helped,\u201d says Blencowe. \u201cI always hear complaints about the council, as anywhere, but they put these butterfly banks in. They don\u2019t look great compared to rows of begonias but they are working and there are enough people in Brighton pushing for them and enjoying them. Other urban areas aren\u2019t going to be chalk grassland but just planting nectar-rich flowers will attract lots of butterflies and bees.\u201d</p> <p>Some councils are getting the message: Dorset, Devon, Cornwall, East Sussex and Bristol are among councils to have adopted \u201cpollinator action plans\u201d. Burnley borough council estimates it is saving \u00a358,000 per year by reducing grass-cutting to benefit wildlife.

It has been used as a medicine for millennia. What\u2019s the problem then? Well let\u2019s look at the very first thing I learned about honey harvesting. Commercial extraction means that the honey the bees have worked so damned hard to produce for their winter food store from the nectar they collect from flowering trees and plants is being replaced with <a href=\"http://beethechangeproject.org/useful-resources/\" title=\"\">a sugar water solution</a>. This is a well-known (and somewhat controversial) large-scale beekeeping practice that could be avoided if enough honey were left for the bees to consume over the winter period. But the beekeepers needs to make a profit, right?</p> <p>Because sugar water is devoid of any crucial protective properties, it\u2019s trickery on an insect level. Without the essential antibiotic/antioxidant shield the honey provides the honey bee is ultimately <a href=\"http://www.naturalnews.com/028055_honeybees_colony_collapse_disorder.html\" title=\"\">left more susceptible to disease</a> \u2013 something that might account for some of our current <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/01/bees-added-to-us-endangered-species-list-for-the-first-time\" title=\"\">\u201cbee decline\u201d crisis</a> and what scientists are referring to as \u201c<a href=\"http://www.ethicalconsumer.org/ethicalreports/honey/beewelfareandhoney.aspx\" title=\"\">colony collapse disorder</a>\u201d. That, coupled with exposure to pesticides means they (and ultimately we), are on a hiding to nothing. It\u2019s a scary prospect to envisage <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/may/31/animalwelfare.environment\" title=\"\">a world without bees</a> and buying honey (or beeswax, propolis and royal jelly for that matter) sadly isn\u2019t going to save us.</p> <p>But we need the honey bees to pollinate our crops, don\u2019t we? Well, yes and no. Honey bees can and do pollinate our crops but they are not necessarily the best for the job. Wild bees are also effective pollinators, but don\u2019t produce honey we can harvest so it\u2019s not worth our time and energy investing in them for honey. On the surface, it appears that honey is merely a by-product of the pollination process, and yet once you dig a little deeper you soon realise that the coveted golden nectar (and the retrieval thereof) is a major concern for commercial beekeepers, along with the lucrative contracts they get from farmers to pollinate their crops.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9cf2852159324531cf03758997b5d7a46d6def7c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9cf2852159324531cf03758997b5d7a46d6def7c/0_0_3413_5120/667.jpg\" alt=\"Jars of English blossom honey and lavender honey\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018 I can wholly understand why some self-proclaimed vegans have no issue in purchasing local, raw honey.\u2019 Jars of English blossom honey and lavender honey for sale in Burford in the Cotswolds.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Graham/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>No bees get harmed in the process of honey production though, right? Not exactly. Industrial bee farming has been known to \u201ccull\u201d hives after harvesting because it\u2019s cheaper than feeding the bees throughout the winter. Those farmers who do choose to keep the hives in operation feed the bees that insipid sugar water, which in turn weakens their immune systems and leaves them vulnerable to infection. In the wild, of course, these bees would be using the honey they diligently harvested to keep themselves going throughout the winter months, arming themselves with all the nourishment they need to see them through. Another tactic implemented by large-scale beekeepers is to clip the wings of the queen bee to prevent swarming, thus ensuring there is no decline in honey production. For the same reason the queen is sometimes killed and replaced with a younger model. Comforting to know we humans don\u2019t apply ageism just to our own species, eh?</p> <p>But what about locally produced honey from small-scale beekeepers? Urban beekeeping is a hugely popular pastime at present and with it come many welcome positives. I tend to think of it as a bit of a grey area \u2013 and my approach to veganism fully acknowledges the reality of these \u201cgrey areas\u201d in our complex, modern society. Even within this growing movement there are several varieties of small-scale beekeeping, a few of which include \u201cbalanced beekeeping\u201d (taking the honey only when it\u2019s in abundance), \u201cnatural beekeeping\u201d (little or no interference with the hive) and \u201cconservation beekeeping\u201d (no honey is taken, the bees are left to their own devices), all of which can help restore the relationship we currently have with the honey bee to a more natural balance.</p> <p>While I personally don\u2019t consume honey and haven\u2019t done for many years, I can wholly understand why some self-proclaimed vegans have no issue in purchasing local, raw honey. Of course, this is a hugely contentious issue that evokes strong emotions but for me this is about making a personal, informed decision not driven simply by the definition of a word.</p> <p>Are you a significantly lesser vegan if you consume a small amount of honey given to you by a \u201c<a href=\"http://www.naturalbeekeepingtrust.org/bee-centred-vs-conventional\" title=\"\">balanced beekeeper</a>\u201d? I don\u2019t yet have the answer to that. But if you\u2019d rather not risk your hard-won vegan credentials, thankfully there is an array of plant-based sweeteners (maple syrup, date syrup and coconut nectar to name but a few) that will keep you satiated and the honey bee safe. And, more importantly, don\u2019t forget you can keep Britain buzzing by planting a <a href=\"https://bumblebeeconservation.org/get-involved/gardening-for-bees\" title=\"\">bee-friendly garden</a> yourself to help encourage all bees to thrive. To use a very un-vegan phrase: there\u2019s more than one way to skin a cat \u2013 or in this case, more than one way to save the bees.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"85a2e055b35965f473b894395a1097f207288c8f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85a2e055b35965f473b894395a1097f207288c8f/0_315_3052_1832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A buff-tailed bumble bee on an azalea flower\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A buff-tailed bumble bee on an azalea flower.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amelia Collins/Friends of the Ea/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>", "wordcount": "931"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}, {"id": "environment/2016/dec/28/national-trust-2016-review-wildlife-weather-bees-butterflies", "type": "article", "sectionId": "environment", "sectionName": "Environment", "webPublicationDate": "2016-12-28T07:00:28Z", "webTitle": "Grass was greener but wildlife struggled in muggy 2016", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/dec/28/national-trust-2016-review-wildlife-weather-bees-butterflies", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/dec/28/national-trust-2016-review-wildlife-weather-bees-butterflies", "fields": {"byline": "Damian Carrington", "body": "<p>Farmers made hay but rampant grass growth in 2016 made life hard for butterflies and even puffin chicks, according to a review of the year\u2019s wildlife and weather by the <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/\">National Trust</a>.</p> <p>The nation\u2019s ever more variable weather brought both booms and busts, with brambles and birds doing well, and slugs flourishing.

However, at nearby Collard Hill, careful grazing helped the large blue butterfly fare better.</p> <p>Profuse grass growth also presented a problem for young puffins on the <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/farne-islands\">Farne Islands</a>. \u201cThe wet spring meant that vegetation grew like mad and the poor pufflings struggled to make their way through the tall grasses out to sea,\u201d said Gwen Potter, the National Trust\u2019s countryside manager for the Northumberland coast.</p> <p>The mild, humid conditions were ideal for flies though, which was good news for some birds, if not for farmers. \u201cIt was a bad summer for flies,\u201d said Kath Birkinshaw, a sheep farmer at Ashes Farm in the Peak District, who said \u201cfly strike\u201d \u2013 maggots \u2013 had afflicted some flocks. </p> <p>\u201cBut it was good for house martins. The birds never usually spend any time on the farm, but in mid-August 300-400 stayed a week on the farm,\u201d she said. Flies like wet summers, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-36166774\">as do slugs</a>, which have plagued gardeners. However, wasps do not, with the National Trust reporting numbers crashing in many areas.</p> <p>Also scarce were field voles, the favourite prey of barn owls. The voles go through three to four years of breeding boom and bust and 2016 appears to have been a deep trough, according to the National Trust, with no barn owl broods seen at Malham in the Yorkshire Dales or at <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/dyrham-park\">Dyrham Park</a>, near Bath.</p> <p>Autumn was dry and mild, turning the leaves on trees into a kaleidoscope of colours, although topsy-turvy weather earlier in the year saw confused sycamore trees on the Dolmelynllyn estate in Snowdonia, shedding leaves in late July, after a hot spell in May was followed by a cold start to the summer.</p> <p>Autumn \u2013 Keats\u2019s season of \u201c<a href=\"http://www.bartleby.com/101/627.html\">mellow fruitfulness</a>\u201d \u2013 is apple harvesting time and there were mixed fortunes in the orchards.

The upside was that the smaller, dense grains were packed with the protein needed to meet top quality milling requirements, helping British farmers exploit a poor year in France. </p> <p>Morgan agrees with the National Trust assessment that the weather is becoming more unsettled, noting that December has seen both very warm and cold weeks. \u201cVariability is increasing and farmers have got to try to work out a way to manage that volatility in the weather,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Globally, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/14/2016-will-be-the-hottest-year-on-record-un-says\">2016 will be the hottest year on record</a>, but Capper is hoping for a proper winter. \u201cWhat we really want now is a cold snap through January and February and then an early start to spring in March,\u201d she said. \u201cFruit crops and hops like a good winter chill: it helps with vernalisation, ie it helps them shut down properly.

But the new research captured all flying insects, including wasps and flies which are rarely studied, making it a much stronger indicator of decline.</p> <p>The fact that the samples were taken in protected areas makes the findings even more worrying, said Caspar Hallmann at Radboud University, also part of the research team: \u201cAll these areas are protected and most of them are well-managed nature reserves.

It could be simply that there is no food for them or it could be, more specifically, exposure to chemical pesticides, or a combination of the two.\u201d</p> <p>In September, a chief scientific adviser to the UK government warned that regulators around the world have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/21/assumed-safety-of-widespread-pesticide-use-is-false-says-top-government-scientist\">falsely assumed that it is safe to use pesticides at industrial scales</a> across landscapes and that the \u201ceffects of dosing whole landscapes with chemicals have been largely ignored\u201d.</p> <p>The scientists said further work is urgently needed to corroborate the new findings in other regions and to explore the issue in more detail. While most insects do fly, it may be that those that don\u2019t, leave nature reserves less often and are faring better. It is also possible that smaller and larger insects are affected differently, and the German samples have all been preserved and will be further analysed.</p> <p>In the meantime, said De Kroon: \u201cWe need to do less of the things that we know have a negative impact, such as the use of pesticides and the disappearance of farmland borders full of flowers.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ebfa2344fb56674d1264e15c07e57b031a27c4f0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ebfa2344fb56674d1264e15c07e57b031a27c4f0/0_0_4282_2890/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bird eating an insect\" width=\"1000\" height=\"675\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">As well as being pollinators insects provide food for birds and other animals and help control pests.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Elsby/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lynn Dicks at the University of East Anglia, UK, and not involved in the new research said the work was convincing. \u201cIt provides important new evidence for an alarming decline that many entomologists have suspected is occurring for some time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf total flying insect biomass is genuinely declining at this rate \u2013 about 6% per year \u2013 it is extremely concerning,\u201d she said. \u201cFlying insects have really important ecological functions, for which their numbers matter a lot.

Like many winter-flowering species, its scent is so strong that it carries for some distance \u2013 I\u2019ve often found myself, nose up in the air, like a cartoon character, wandering around streets and into parks trying to pinpoint that heady, sweet fragrance. It\u2019s not there to please you, however, but to guide in pollinators still on the wing. To win the competition game in winter, flowers need to be perfumed with the sort of scent that travels and lingers \u2013 which is why, once they weigh up the rewards of scent versus showiness, nearly all winter-flowering plants choose scent: robust, small flowers can withstand the weather better than big, blowsy ones.</p> <p>Left to its own devices, winter honeysuckle grows into a handsome shrub, densely branched and rounded. It can be coaxed to hug a wall or fence, and although initially it may need tying in, eventually the stems will twine. The best cultivar is \u2018Winter Beauty\u2019, which has clusters of cream flowers with prominent, yellow anthers. It\u2019s a tough thing, as happy in an exposed site as in a sheltered one, and it\u2019s not fussy which way it faces, provided it has some sun. It also makes a lovely cut flower, so if the weather outside is too much, bring some indoors. Sweetest honeysuckle (<a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/details?plantid=4560\"><em>L. fragrantissima</em></a>) is slightly more tidy and compact.</p> <p>The award for the best winter scent, however, has to go to wintersweet (<a href=\"http://www.kew.org/science-conservation/plants-fungi/chimonanthus-praecox-wintersweet\"><em>Chimonanthus praecox</em></a>). In fact, this plant is so hell-bent on bringing all the bees to your yard that it flowers on bare stems, so there\u2019s no mistaking what to head for. The flowers start in December and continue into February. They are small, yellow and waxy, tough little things that can take the wet and wind, and have a delicious, spicy scent. Wintersweet likes sun and well-drained soil, and will do well against a wall. But it is shy to flower, and it can be several years before it does its thing.

He told them this in a sermon called \u201cThe Invisible World\u201d. Angels and the souls of the dead were constantly active, but people\u2019s senses could not perceive them. Anyone who found this difficult to believe should remember, Newman said, that, after all, there was another surrounding world of which people knew almost as little: the animal world. Animals were everywhere. Their presence was familiar. Yet the emotional lives of these creatures, their perceptions and the reasons for their behaviour, remained so hidden that Newman could compare this concealed life to a world of spirits.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/12/peter-wohlleben-man-who-believes-trees-talk-to-each-other\" title=\"\">Peter Wohlleben</a> is a Rhineland forester who became unhappy with industrial methods. Remarkably, he persuaded the municipal owners of his forest to end their commercial contracts and abandon those methods. He is scientific and secular, yet he too perceives that we live in a world of intelligence and emotional complexity that goes unseen. Traditional relationships with farm animals, hunted animals and pets have always provided insights into that world, but only science can reveal the depths. Combining scientific reports with tales of his own observations, Wohlleben tentatively begins to uncover that world and explore its implications for our behaviour.</p> <p>In 2015, his book<em> </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/31/trees-talk-have-sex-look-after-young-peter-wohlleben-hay-festival\" title=\"\"><em>The Hidden Life of Trees</em></a> revealed a forest unimagined by most walkers. Communities of trees will send sugar through their roots or through underground thread-like fungi to keep alive the stumps of felled individuals. These fungal networks connect all the trees in an undisturbed forest. A teaspoon of soil contains many miles of filaments. One scientist calls them the \u201cwood wide web\u201d. They take chemical information from tree to tree \u2013 about predators, weather, drought and other damage. Trees also signal to each other by releasing chemicals, and when a tree recognises the saliva of an insect that is eating its leaves, the tree releases pheromones that attract the right predators. Wohlleben reveals the forest as a complex system of entities reacting to each other. There are families, communities, rogue individuals, symbiotic exchanges and predator-prey relationships. Large things are the product of small, and vice versa. <a href=\"https://www.guardianbookshop.com/hidden-life-of-trees.html\" title=\"\"><em>The Hidden Life of Trees</em></a> became a surprise international bestseller.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"61d7258e94bd84ff2e88ee65eece0e1d4344bb0b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61d7258e94bd84ff2e88ee65eece0e1d4344bb0b/0_77_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018When a crow sees Wohlleben watching, it pretends to bury the acorn it is carrying, and takes the treasure elsewhere.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018When a crow sees Wohlleben watching, it pretends to bury the acorn it is carrying, and takes the treasure elsewhere.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: YONHAP/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Environmentalists hope that such books will bring new scientific and ethical perspectives to a public audience. Wohlleben writes in support of the new biology that challenges the old idea that plants and many animals are little more than mechanisms. Deprived of that view, intensive industrial farming would be unconscionable. Early on, he asks the fundamental question: \u201cIs there really only one way \u2013 the human way \u2013 to experience feelings intensely and perhaps consciously?\u201d In 2012, leading neuroscientists published \u201cThe Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness\u201d, which stated that the physical processes associated with consciousness in humans could be found in many other creatures, including insects and molluscs. The neocortex \u2013 the outer layer of the upper brain, possessed only by mammals and most highly developed in humans and apes \u2013 was not the only organ producing emotion and intention. Could the popularity of Wohlleben\u2019s writing, and the current surge in nature writing of all kinds, be evidence not only of our environmental worries but of the arrival in mainstream culture of a new delight in the complexity of ecological relationships? Can we respond to the science by developing a new sense of kinship and&#xa0;responsibility?</p> <p><em>The Inner Life of Animals</em> poses these questions more challengingly. Wohlleben\u2019s revelations about trees were startling, but it remains hard to entertain the idea that our consciences should be troubled by plants feeling pain and fear. We can feel delight at the intricate, sensitive lives of trees without having to question our continuing use of wood. Animals are another matter. Discoveries about animal feelings and intelligence raise questions of conscience with which we already struggle.</p> <p>So <em>The Inner Life of Animals</em> does not&#xa0;have quite the power to surprise that the tree book did. And there is not quite the same atmosphere of place. Shafts of light and mossy greens fill <em>The Hidden Life of Trees</em>. The reader does not leave the forest, and this aura intensifies the awareness of intricate natural life that the book has to offer. So much is happening in this one place. The colours, airs and sounds are all connected. They give us contact with the invisible world we now know to be&#xa0;there.</p> <p><em>The Inner Life of Animals</em> has something of this effect, since it too is pervaded by one ecosystem. Most of the anecdotes feature animals in Wohlleben\u2019s forest or his home and paddocks. There are squirrels, butterflies, deer, jays, hedgehogs, moths, foxes, mice, weevils, woodpeckers, beetles, slow worms, slime moulds, wild boar, dogs, horses, goats, bees, ravens, rabbits, crows, sparrowhawks and swifts. Only occasionally does he look further afield, to laboratory animals or vampire bats. Still, the stories are more dispersed than in the tree book, more loosely related. There is not the same concentration of light and colour. But the book is always fascinating.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/31/trees-talk-have-sex-look-after-young-peter-wohlleben-hay-festival\">Trees talk to each other, have sex and look after their young, says author</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Voice more than place holds the stories together. Wry, avuncular, careful and kind, Wohlleben guides us from one creature to the next. When horns sound for the first time each year, wild boar swim the Rh\u00f4ne to Geneva where hunting is outlawed. Mice are distressed when another mouse suffers, especially one they know. Sows act as midwives for their daughters. When a crow sees Wohlleben watching, it pretends to bury the acorn it is carrying, and surreptitiously takes the treasure elsewhere. Wanting to fill its crop with the corn Wohlleben always brings, the crow does not eat the acorn immediately. But Wohlleben must not see where the nut is hidden.</p> <p>Chimps see themselves in a mirror and rub off paint that scientists have dabbed on their faces. They know they are seeing images of themselves. Slime moulds, single-cell organisms with many nuclei, previously classified as fungi but now of uncertain status and possibly animals, find their way to food through mazes, detecting from their trails that they have taken a path before. A great tit sounds the alarm call when no hawk is present in order to scare off other tits and take the best food. Each story adds to a widening vision of intelligence, emotion and relationship.</p> <p>A technique that helps Wohlleben establish his friendly tone is the use of&#xa0;affectionate anthropomorphisms. Squirrels are \u201crusty rascals\u201d. Slow worms attracted to the warmth of the road surface are \u201clittle sun-worshippers\u201d. At first these phrases seemed cartoonish, but as the book deepens, they acquire a different meaning. Wohlleben makes us ponder, throughout, whether it is right to think of animal abilities using concepts that describe human intelligence and emotion. There is no simple answer. To do so denies the animals their strangeness, but to refuse is to restrain the moral meaning that animals have for us \u2013 the complex, developing, non-reductive meaning. It is to deny the capacity of animals to suggest things about ourselves. Finding such meaning in animals is one of our primal ways of relating to them.</p> <p>Anthropomorphism is necessary, then, but it must be accompanied by recognition of strangeness. The gently teasing phrases pull the reader up short and prompt that correction.</p> <p>One piece of behaviour provokes this dilemma starkly. Male bears, like male lions and tigers, kill cubs that other males have fathered. They do this to bring the mother back into season. It&#xa0;is an act that shocks television narrators. Wohlleben says we should not regard these males as evil, since the behaviour is normal for the species. He could have gone on&#xa0;to say that, without blaming the males, we need to feel horrified by the loss of those infant lives. The book\u2019s impulse throughout is a willingness to value all&#xa0;forms of life quite as far as is humanly possible.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>The Inner Life of Animals: Surprising Observations of a Hidden World</em> is published by Bodley Head.

Plants known to be particularly at risk from air pollution include harebell (<em>Campanula rotundifolia</em>), which was recently classified as near-threatened in England, and bird\u2019s-foot trefoil (<em>Lotus corniculatus</em>), which supports more invertebrates than any other herb. Soil fungi and their dependents, including many cherished orchids, are also especially vulnerable. Species richness depletion from air pollution has knock-on effects for bees, birds and all the other wildlife which depend on healthy plantlife.</p> <p>The \u201cmarch of US-style mega-farms\u201d is of great concern given that more than 90% of wildlife hotspots in England and Wales already have nitrogen levels higher than they can tolerate.

The land is adjacent to The Hurst, a writers\u2019 retreat run by national creative writing charity Arvon in the Shropshire Hills countryside close to Clun. Poet laureate Carol Ann Duffy describes Arvon as \u201cthe single most important organisation for sharing and exploring creative writing in the UK\u201d.</p> <p>The Grade II-listed Hurst, built in 1813, and a former home of playwright John Osborne, underwent a \u00a32.3m renovation in 2013 supported by Arts Council England. It has a significant effect on the local economy as over 800 people come to Arvon\u2019s writing courses and retreats held there each year. Eight permanent staff are employed at the 19-bedroom house and 26-acre estate. It is estimated that over \u00a3170,000 is spent by Arvon each year in the area, purchasing food and services from local suppliers and tradespeople, such as food suppliers and caterers, cleaners, taxi drivers, plumbers and builders.</p> <p>However, over the course of our objection to the plans to erect this inappropriate mega-farm in the Clun valley, we came up against officers and councillors who held fast to a regressive and philistine view of the countryside as a site of intensive agriculture at any price, waving aside the undeniable new economic model that is thriving under their very noses. They prefer an unsustainable system which ships its feed thousands of miles from the Americas and destroys our hedgerows with 44-ton lorries driving at dead of night.</p> <p>John Osborne called the view from The Hurst \u201cprobably the best view in England\u201d.

While the farming sector is evolving to meet a growing demand for food, it is also the case that the number of farms has decreased in the past few years.</p> <p>What hasn\u2019t changed is the high quality, safe, traceable and affordable food being produced by British farmers to exacting welfare and environmental standards. The key thing for any livestock farmer is the health and welfare of their animals. And as veterinarians and the farmers themselves can testify, farm size is not a measure for the welfare of an animal. What does impact on animal welfare is the quality of management and stockmanship that farms operate to.&#xa0;</p> <p>UK farmers are leaders in good husbandry and high animal welfare and environmental standards which are grounded in robust science and innovative technology \u2013 all of which plays a major role in balancing the need to produce more British food in a way that is sustainable environmentally, economically and socially.<br><strong>Minette Batters</strong><br><em>Deputy president, National Farmers Union</em></p> <p>\u2022 It is welcome to see the new Defra secretary, Michael Gove, argue that the retained public funding for agriculture should reward environmental benefits rather than land ownership.</p> <p>A settlement based on environmental and public benefits, however, will not necessarily hasten the death of small family farms (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/23/the-guardian-view-on-brexit-and-farming-outlook-unsettled\" title=\"\">Editorial</a>, 24 July). For the first time in recent memory, a secretary of state is talking about small family farms rather than just production and growth. At last, we are having more discussions about how the market supports the industry.</p> <p>Further, we now have the opportunity to introduce a new funding model that protects farms of all sizes alongside the much-improved delivery of environmental benefits. The government can investigate ways to introduce tiered models of funding that recognise the different economies of scale for farms, or reward a progressive approach to husbandry across the whole farm.<br><strong>Graeme Willis</strong><br><em>Food and farming campaigner, Campaign to Protect Rural England</em></p> <p>\u2022 The demand for humanely raised pork is rising steadily as people become aware of the appalling cruelty and reckless overuse of antibiotics in factory pig farms and the toxic stench suffered by people unfortunate enough to live near one of the 800 mega-farms in the UK. Some 40% of sows in the UK live permanently outdoors \u2013 a fact conveniently ignored by industrial farming lobbyist Zoe Davis, from the National Pig Association, when she stated: \u201cThere aren\u2019t many producers that farm pigs outdoors because there\u2019s not a huge demand.\u201d The reader can help bring an end to this onslaught of cruelty by looking for high animal welfare labels. For pigs that is RSPCA Assured, Outdoor Bred, Free Range and Organic. To help understand why this meat tastes better, look no further than the <a href=\"http://farmsnotfactories.org/\" title=\"\">Farms Not Factories</a> website, where famous chefs explain why they would only ever serve meat from high animal welfare farms. It is more expensive, but not after a true cost analysis looking at the antibiotics given to factory-farmed animals to stave off disease. Antibiotic-resistant diseases reach the neighbouring community and beyond on the meat, and bring us all ever closer to the day when antibiotics won\u2019t work to cure basic human diseases. A recent survey found antibiotic resistant <em>E coli</em> on 63% of factory-farmed pork in UK supermarkets. To spread the cost of buying high welfare, eat less but better meat and avoid diseases related to overeating meat like obesity, diabetes, heart disease and colon cancer.<br><strong>Tracy Worcester</strong><br><em>Farms not Factories</em></p> <p>\u2022 Reports on \u201cmega-farms\u201d persist in linking large scale farming with high antibiotic use \u2013 despite featuring poultry farmer Richard Williams, who says no antibiotic has been used on his site since it was set up two years ago (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/17/close-to-the-sheds-the-smell-is-overpowering-inside-a-herefordshire-mega-farm\" title=\"\">About 42,000 birds inside \u2013 and a sweet, sickly smell outside</a>, 18 July).</p> <p>Richard is not alone. Since 2012, members of the British Poultry Council\u2019s Antibiotic Stewardship scheme, representing more than 90% of UK poultry meat production, have achieved a 71% reduction in total antibiotic use. The latest UK data highlights a 10% fall in antibiotic sales for farm animals. Sales of highest priority antibiotics to farming have also fallen, and new pig industry data shows use of colistin dropped by over 70% between 2015 and 2016 \u2013 despite UK farming already being one of the lowest users in Europe.</p> <p>It may suit campaign groups to add antibiotics to the list of issues they have with larger-scale farming, but resorting to global or European data and analogies because the UK data doesn\u2019t back their case is disingenuous.

Two different Americans, Frederick Cook in 1908 and Robert Peary in 1909, said they were the first to reach the pole, and in 1926 another, Richard Byrd, claimed he was the first to fly there. All their claims have since been cast in doubt. In the 1920s Mussolini used the airship exploits of the Italian Umberto Nobile to promote his regime. When Nobile went missing in 1928 the great Norwegian Roald Amundsen, although he didn\u2019t care for fascism, would die in the internationally publicised race to find him.</p> <p>The Arctic can have this effect on people: its function in the imagination of the world is as a place to test or define, to look for some truth about existence by viewing it from its limit. The challenge of its otherness might explain why Mary Shelley chose to open Frankenstein in the Arctic wastes, and why the Soviets built the showcase coalmining town of <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/soviet-ghost-town-arctic-circle-pyramiden-stands-alone-180951429/\">Pyramiden</a> more grandly and formally than its function required. Now the significance of the Arctic is above all about climate change, its effects there being particularly visible, significant and dangerous.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What if we couldn\u2019t stand each other, on this vessel alone on icy seas? Agatha Christie would have loved the scenario</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The belief that the Arctic has something to tell us motivates the <a href=\"http://thearcticcircle.org/\">Arctic Circle residency</a>, a programme whereby artists, scientists and writers can, for half the actual cost, take part in expeditions aboard a tall sailing ship, around the coasts and islands of Svalbard. Feeling the need for new perspectives on life, I applied \u2013 and in early June joined 28 other participants, plus guides and crew, on the three-masted barquentine Antigua. Two weeks without night or internet, ignorant of World Cup results and the latest Trump eruptions, voyaging between 78 and 81 degrees north, going where the wind suggested, marvelling at glaciers in shades of blue beyond the power of words or cameras to capture \u2013 cobalt? cerulean? sapphire? \u201cAre you going to find yourself,\u201d teased a friend, \u201cunder an iceberg?\u201d</p> <p>There is an element of the mythical about Svalbard. Its mention can draw blank looks, except from readers of Philip Pullman who know it as the land of armoured bears but who still don\u2019t know much about the nonfictional version. It is better known as Spitsbergen, the name given by the Dutch navigator Willem Barents when he discovered it in 1596, more than a century after Columbus reached America. Norwegian patriotism led to its renaming in the 20th century: through the optimistic reading of an ambiguous medieval account, it was decided that the Vikings had got there first and called it Svalbard. It is, in any case, an archipelago far north of Norway, a bit smaller than Scotland, the last bit of Europe before the north pole. The name Spitsbergen is still applied to its largest island.</p> <p>Svalbard\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Svalbard,+Svalbard+and+Jan+Mayen/@76.8372004,6.7904879,4z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x45a1cfdc4fa3c049:0x2bf373e71b35e875!8m2!3d77.8749725!4d20.9751821\">shape on a map</a>, a splat of kelp upon a rock, may be the least familiar in Europe. It occupies the zone where Mercator\u2019s and other projections dissolve into absurdity, with Svalbard becoming either nonsensically big or weirdly distorted, sometimes getting left out altogether. On globes it can disappear beneath the black plastic cap that holds the object in place. An azimuthal projection, the kind that puts the north pole at the centre of concentric circles of latitude, reveals it to have more to do with the cold family of Arctic lands \u2013 Greenland, the islands of north Russia and Canada \u2013 than with the European mainland.</p> <p>Human history has a shallow grip on Svalbard. Before Barents (or those Vikings) arrived, there were no indigenous populations, no equivalent of Inuit in north America, nobody at all. It wasn\u2019t until the 20th century that people started living there permanently, and such life has been extreme, framed by tales of endurance and danger: explorers stuck in the ice through long winters, stranded travellers surviving in snow holes for months, whalers taking insane risks in pursuit of profit, the appalling working conditions and mortality rates of miners.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a7d538c6c0ad5c197966e37c9bfdcdf76a114174\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7d538c6c0ad5c197966e37c9bfdcdf76a114174/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Other people can be scarier\u2026\u2019: some of the 28 writers and artists who joined the Arctic Circle residency on Svalbard last month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Some of the 29 writers and artists who joined the Arctic Circle residency on Svalbard last month. In the distance is the Wahlenbergbreen glacier, which \u2018resembles an army of orks\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leslie Leong</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Animal and plant life, too, looks like something that could easily be scraped off the surface of the land. Springy moss, purple and yellow saxifrage, and a type of buttercup stay within centimetres of the ground. There are no trees, except for low, flat willow and birch that take decades to reach the size of dinner plates. There are no butterflies or bees. Whereas the polar sea is abundant in life, vertebrate species on land are few, if memorable: polar bears, arctic fox, reindeer, ptarmigan.</p> <p>Instead there is naked geology, exemplary sedimentary mountains whose layers were formed by hundreds of millions of years of shifting land and sea, back to a time when what is now Svalbard was located south of the equator. On one edge, where plate movements pressed it against what is now Greenland, they twist and buckle. Elsewhere equally exemplary igneous rocks, formed in intense heat and pressure in the earlier history of the planet, create the hard, spiky skylines that gave Spitsbergen (\u201cpointed mountains\u201d) its name.</p> <p>Formations that in other lands would be worth a journey by themselves are here commonplace. They are unforgiving, even tedious, in their sterile magnificence. Animation comes from the clarity, luminosity and subtle alterations of the famous Arctic light. Because the light reflects in all directions off snow and ice, and because sunshine comes (especially around midnight) at a low angle, you are suspended in it. At the same hour, when the shadows deepen and when a light meter would register a lowering of levels but all still looks dazzling, there is a bright-dark quality comparable to that of a solar eclipse.</p> <p>Along with rock and light, the landscape is made of four other elements \u2013 ice, snow, cloud and water \u2013 all, of course, variants of the same substance. Their changes and interactions are infinite. You know them underfoot, hard or collapsing, as well as by sight. Above all, there are the glaciers, one after another, covering much of Svalbard, crackling and growling with their internal forces, crumbling into pillars and pinnacles with the unsteady and unlikely beauty of the about-to-collapse. One in particular, the currently surging glacier of Wahlenbergbreen, resembles an army of orks, ranks of ugly upright giants marching to their collapse into the sea, where they will turn into glistening floating ornaments, whose cute technical name is \u201cbergy bits\u201d.</p> <p>You see clearly that everything is in inorganic motion, if at different speeds \u2013 waves, ice, strata, continental plates, weather. There are similarities of patterns: a field of moss looks like a mountain range, ice floes drift like clouds, glacier ice behaves like rock, only speeded up. All landscapes are temporary, as the architect Cedric Price said of buildings, but some are more temporary than others.</p> <p>The Arctic\u2019s absence of measures like trees and houses makes it hard to read the scale of a glacier \u2013 100ft high? 400ft? More? Dry haze-less air makes distance inscrutable, removing the aerial perspective that helps us read depth. The sun\u2019s 24-hour, 360-degree path messes with time and orientation. It is otherworldly. It is a sketch of another planet. It is not greatly bothered about human presence, even though human presence has the potential to be devastating: whatever the poltroons who deny it might say, this ice is indeed retreating and, quite apart from its effects when it turns up in melted form in a town or field near you, a world of beauty will be destroyed.</p> <p>So there we were, a group of strangers collectively categorised as creative, industriously trying to make sense of it all. We were mostly from the anglosphere \u2013 Canadians, Americans, British, Australians \u2013 with a Peruvian and a Norwegian. The guides and crew, some of them artists and writers themselves, some former participants in the residency who liked Svalbard so much that they came back, were part of the collective exploratory society.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3f417af8dbbe38c9bf52ec311a8d0acfa0cf6ca2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f417af8dbbe38c9bf52ec311a8d0acfa0cf6ca2/0_0_5184_3888/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Solitary specks in the vast landscapes\u2019: a cabin on Svalbard.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Solitary specks in the vast landscapes\u2019: a cabin on Svalbard \u2013 the last one before the north pole.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rowan Moore</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cDon\u2019t get eaten by a polar bear\u201d was common advice before I left, but Other People were scarier. What if we couldn\u2019t stand each other, on this vessel alone on icy seas? Agatha Christie would have loved the scenario: a confined space, multiple personal histories, several ways to die. It didn\u2019t seem auspicious that my allocated cabin-mate greeted me with a box of earplugs and the warning that he snores. But I slept, partly by imagining that his occasional rumblings were the sounds of glaciers or walruses. Collectively we participants got along well, not only because it was clearly dumb not to, but also because this was a group of likable and dedicated people. There were irritations, to be sure, and occasional outbreaks of what might be considered madness, but the overwhelming experience was the pleasure of encountering people we wouldn\u2019t have met otherwise, and making lasting friendships.</p> <p>We were conscious of a precedent \u2013 in 2005 a group called Cape Farewell organised a residency in Svalbard that included Ian McEwan and Antony Gormley, that formed the basis of McEwan\u2019s novel <em tabindex=\"-1\">Solar</em>. We were a less starry bunch but possibly we had a better time, not least because they went in the harsh month of March. It helped that we were lucky with wildlife \u2013 two blue whales within an hour of leaving port, six bears in three sightings, an extended viewing of an ugly of walruses, plus seals, arctic fox, reindeer and an array of birds. (And, yes, according to some contested sources an \u201cugly\u201d is a collective noun for those large brown sea beasts.)</p> <p>If it would be nice to tell daring tales of narrow escapes but the truth is that dangerous places have to be highly managed. On land, you can\u2019t leave the protection of the guides, who are armed with rifles as a last resort against polar bears (although there was a mildly alarming moment involving a grounded boat and a curious bear). You could swim in the extremely cold water or go up the ship\u2019s foremast in a safety harness, but these are hardly epic adventures.</p> <p>Rather, we busied ourselves with our personal attempts to respond to the Arctic. Two artists, <a href=\"http://www.adamkuby.com/\">Adam Kuby</a> from Portland Oregon and Shohei Katayama from Pittsburg, collaborated on filling a crack in ice with gold-coloured fabric and photographed it. Emma Hoette, one of the crew, who is currently studying at the Laban centre in London, reprised <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/258417728\">a performance where she sits on a cold rock</a>, naked but for a woollen neck warmer that she slowly unravels. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://philipkanwischer.com/about/\">Philip Kanwischer</a>, from Calgary, made a digitally altered photograph of our anxieties: that curious bear multiplied several times over. All had to observe the same rule: you may leave nothing behind on the islands and beaches and take nothing away. Any manmade objects that might be older than 1946 \u2013 barrel hoops, shoes, broken bottles \u2014 are designated as cultural artefacts and must not be touched.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Arctic doesn\u2019t give a damn about us. If it could have a preference, it would want us dead</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Writers took notes for future poems and essays. I read an account of the 1873 expedition of the explorer <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24281727\">Benjamin Leigh Smith</a>, who happens to have been my great-great-great uncle, and traced the intersections of his routes with ours. In Mosselbukta, where he found a Swedish expedition that had spent the Arctic winter trapped by ice, I saw the ruins of a flatpacked house these pre-Ikea Swedes had built. It later collapsed; its timbers are miraculously preserved by the dry, cold air.</p> <p>As a writer on architecture, I had imagined that the appeal of the Arctic would include its lack of my usual subject matter, but there are buildings there too, all the more poignant for their survival in hostile places. There are the structures of coalmining, mineheads perched on near-cliffs and long-legged conveyor systems that recall the inventions of HG Wells or the <a href=\"http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/a/archigram-walking-city-living-pod-instant-city/\">Walking Cities of the 1960s architectural group Archigram</a>. There are trappers\u2019 huts, researchers\u2019 cabins and tiny refuges for travellers, all solitary specks in the vast landscape. There is the steel mast from which in 1926 Raoul Amundsen and Umberto Nobile, at that point collaborating with each other, flew in an airship to the north pole.</p> <p>These structures are to the point. They waste no energy. They combine flimsy-looking tarpaper with oversized driftwood because that is what is to hand. It would be lost effort to cut up the wood into more proportionate pieces. Decorated at most with reindeer antlers or a bear\u2019s jawbone, they have the striking aesthetic of buildings that don\u2019t have time for aesthetics, their unusual asymmetries of lightness and mass being responses to unusual conditions.</p> <p>The same cannot be said of <a href=\"http://www.spitsbergentravel.com/Start/About-Svalbard/Geography/Svalbard-Videos-Pyramiden/\">Pyramiden</a>, a piece of the Soviet Union on foreign soil, made possible by international treaty that gives certain countries additional to Norway rights to Svalbard. It is now a frigid modern Pompeii, where guided tours can visit the dead 1990s house plants, the idle kitchen equipment, the northernmost grand piano and the increasingly quaint office machines that were left behind when, following the collapse of the Soviet Union and with it the withdrawal of the town\u2019s state support, Pyramiden was abandoned. The black coal fields, striking after all that pure ice, are apocalyptic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a4b883a2102cead7ac0201b826e1d4107a1ca623\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4b883a2102cead7ac0201b826e1d4107a1ca623/0_0_5184_3888/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A bust of Lenin gazes over Pyramiden, the \u2018frigid modern Pompeii\u2019 that was once a thriving Soviet outpost.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A bust of Lenin gazes over Pyramiden, the<br> \u2018frigid modern Pompeii\u2019 that was once a thriving<br> Soviet outpost.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rowan Moore</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In its 1970s heyday it was an exhibition town, a sought-after posting for Soviet citizens, with model apartment buildings and the world\u2019s northernmost bust of Lenin gazing down an avenue nicknamed the Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es. It has the only turf in Svalbard, imported from the Ukraine, on which the only dandelions sometimes flower. It has a shed where strawberries were grown. Its buildings are higher than anywhere else in the archipelago, and its mining structures more elaborate and massive \u2013 as much to make them impressive as out of necessity. As an exercise in pitting man against nature, with the associated effects of hubris, it has something in common with the Swedish balloon.</p> <p>Svalbard architecture exposes with special lucidity the heroism and foibles of human life, which is what the Arctic does more generally. It doesn\u2019t give a damn about us. If it could have a preference, it would want us dead. But its very implacability makes us want to read ourselves in it and enables us to do so. The message of those sedimentary mountains is that, over a scale of tens of millions of years, nature will probably shrug off whatever monstrosities we inflict on it, as it has previous catastrophes like meteorites and volcanic explosions, but that will be much too late for us. This realisation makes climate change more urgent, not less. We made this problem and it is down to us to fix it. There is no one and nothing else to help us.</p> <p>It\u2019s a little preposterous to seek the meaning of the Arctic, but if it has one it\u2019s in what it reflects. One of the strangest sights was, after 10 days\u2019 sailing, of a man we hadn\u2019t met before. Wonders included the rediscovery, over a return via Oslo airport to Britain, of crowds, summer warmth, trees, trucks, streetlamps, passwords, football results and new Trump eruptions much like the old ones, of a snail trail and a mulberry bush in the garden. Some of these things seemed inconsequential, some repulsive, some precious. A possibly obvious truth was vividly reinforced, which is that there is no fundamental reason why any of them are here. We\u2019d miss them, some of them, if they weren\u2019t.</p> <p><em>This article was amended on 29 July 2018 to add the name of an artist.</em></p>", "wordcount": "2768"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "lifeandstyle/2017/apr/16/grow-your-own-herbs-and-spices", "type": "article", "sectionId": "lifeandstyle", "sectionName": "Life and style", "webPublicationDate": "2017-04-16T05:00:22Z", "webTitle": "Grow your own herbs and spices", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/apr/16/grow-your-own-herbs-and-spices", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2017/apr/16/grow-your-own-herbs-and-spices", "fields": {"byline": "James Wong", "body": "<p>Of all homegrown crops, to me no others have a more stark \u201cnight and day\u201d flavour difference than that of fresh herbs. This is because the aromatic compounds that give these plants their characteristic flavour are constantly evaporating off the surfaces of their leaves, wafting into the air around them. This is precisely the reason why we can smell them, but it also means cut herbs are constantly losing their scent in the journey from farm to fork.</p> <p>In one recent trial on coriander, after a week or so of storage the cut leaves had lost the vast majority of these fragrant chemicals. The researchers \u2013 investigating how to extend shelf life in supermarket herbs \u2013 highlighted the fact that the coriander still looked cosmetically perfect as a positive thing.</p> <p>Fortunately, herbs can also be the easiest of all crops to grow, even for a beginner. You don\u2019t need any special kit or even a trip to the garden centre, as a range of both everyday and unusual herb seeds can be found in your spice rack. Take any of the following seeds from jars in your kitchen cupboard, sprinkle them over a bed of newly raked soil in a sunny spot, water in well and you are on your way.</p> <p>Both fennel and its close relative dill are so easy to grow I have seen both pop up on railway lines, gravel patches alongside motorways and even on abandoned building sites. They look great, too \u2013 creating frothy towers of filigree leaves and architectural flowers which bees just love.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I have seen fennel and dill pop up on railway lines, gravel patches alongside motorways and an abandoned building site</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I used to think I wasn\u2019t a huge fan of chamomile tea until I tried it brewed from the fresh flowers, which have an almost impossibly fragrant pineapple-like scent. Surprisingly, the easiest way to get your hands on loads of seed is to rip open an (unused) chamomile tea bag. These will contain loads of fertilised flowers and thus are a great source of viable seed. Try the fresh flowers and leaves not only in tea, but chopped and added to dishes as you would parsley or dill.</p> <p>If you want something more conventional, why not try coriander seeds? I\u2019ll admit that I haven\u2019t tried this on account of my loathing of coriander leaves, as along with about 15% of the population I carry an allele of the OR6A2 gene which causes it to taste not fresh and fragrant to me, but like soap.</p> <p>Finally, they are not quite \u201cherbs\u201d, but mustard seeds will sprout to produce lush, leafy greens that can be harvested as baby salads or saut\u00e9ed up as a tasty spinach substitute. Want a fragrant green that is just as easy but without their fiery flavour? Go for fenugreek, whose incredible warm richness makes it one of my favourite greens, all for such little effort. </p> <p>How To Eat Better <em>by James Wong is published by Mitchell Beazley at \u00a320.

What was written about and thought about in the house was put into practice in the garden. And it was from the main bedroom that Darwin could best survey what went on outside. That is why it is so important to understanding Darwin.\u201d</p> <p>Darwin moved into Down House, in the village of Downe near Orpington, in 1842, after his round-the-world trip on HMS Beagle, and he began developing his theory of evolution, carrying out a host of garden experiments to test out his ideas. These included small test plots of dug-up soil that can still be seen from the bedroom.

And, because bees pollinate clover, he argued that we should find more clover in fields where there are lots of cats.\u201d</p> <p>Darwin also dusted bees with flour so that his children could identify them and follow them through the fields. \u201cFrom this work, he suggested bees were laying down some kind of chemical trails for other bees to follow,\u201d added Blaik. \u201cWe know these today as pheromone trails.\u201d</p> <p>Darwin died in 1882, and Emma followed in 1896, after which the house was rented out before being turned, in 1907, into a girls\u2019 school.

If that\u2019s a recipe for madness, the kind solution is to let as many flower as you can before they set seed: it\u2019s not always easy to time, but leaving a few dandelions in the lawn, or lifting the cutting height of the mowers so that speedwell, daisies and blue bugle (<a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/742/Ajuga-reptans/Details\"><em>Ajuga reptans</em></a><em>)</em> can flower between the grass, is simple enough.</p> <p>Weeds in beds and borders fall broadly into two categories: annuals or perennials. I think of the annual weeds as good therapy \u2013 there is nothing I like more than to get into the rhythm of pulling a particular weed. You learn just how hard you must pull to get the whole plant up, roots and all, and there\u2019s something deeply meditative about this sort of work. Those gentle spring days after a night of rain are manna for weeding: the soil is syrupy and soft, so with a gentle tug the likes of speedwell, <a href=\"http://www.wildlifetrusts.org/species/cleavers\">cleavers</a>, young nettles, <a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?PID=782\">bittercress</a> or <a href=\"http://www.wildlifetrusts.org/species/dogs-mercury\">dog\u2019s mercury</a> pull away from the sucking earth in such a pleasing manner.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/apr/01/alys-fowler-how-to-stop-rats-and-mice-eating-seeds\">Alys Fowler: how to stop mice, rats and squirrels eating your seeds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The other sorts are a little trickier. The perennials are determined to stay and their roots are hard to pull up, often snapping. Every little bit that\u2019s left behind reproduces. You can tell perennial weeds from annuals because they tend to have thicker, tougher, more extensive roots.</p> <p>There are numerous ways to deal with perennial weeds. On the allotment, I am a big fan of lasagne growing \u2013 covering weeds in thick layers of cardboards, rotting organic matter and more cardboard to smother them. If you can\u2019t do this because there are already perennials in place, then hand-weeding is the only way. Don\u2019t dig, it\u2019s pointless \u2013 ruining the soil structure and spreading the weeds about; instead, use a hand fork or small border fork and tease out those knotting roots. Again, choose the right weather \u2013 damp soil, cool enough to work up a rhythm perhaps; stick on your favourite podcast and get lost in the satisfaction of hunting for white roots of bindweed, or ground elder.</p> <p>Keep your perennial weeds in a separate pile from the stuff for your compost. Perennial weeds need to be treated differently from ordinary compost waste: their persistent nature means that only the hottest of composts will kill them. One solution is to rot them first in a bucket of water. This is known as weed soup \u2013 when it stinks, pour it over the compost. The joy here is that you are keeping within your system all the nutrients perennial weeds are so good at taking up, rather than throwing them away. Anything with thick taproots, such as dock, dandelion, alkanet and comfrey, will accumulate minerals from the soil, so their weed soup is particularly nutritious. If there\u2019s a lot of liquid I&#xa0;use it to feed pot plants, before dumping the sludge on the compost.</p> <p>Next time, I\u2019ll look at groundcover, mulches and green manures to stop weeds returning.</p>", "wordcount": "581"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}, {"id": "environment/2016/sep/22/pesticide-manufacturers-own-tests-reveal-serious-harm-to-honeybees", "type": "article", "sectionId": "environment", "sectionName": "Environment", "webPublicationDate": "2016-09-22T06:00:42Z", "webTitle": "Pesticide manufacturers' own tests reveal serious harm to honeybees", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/22/pesticide-manufacturers-own-tests-reveal-serious-harm-to-honeybees", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/sep/22/pesticide-manufacturers-own-tests-reveal-serious-harm-to-honeybees", "fields": {"byline": "Damian Carrington", "body": "<p>Unpublished field trials by pesticide manufacturers show their products cause serious harm to honeybees at high levels, leading to calls from senior scientists for the companies to end the secrecy which cloaks much of their research.</p> <p>The research, conducted by Syngenta and Bayer on their neonicotinoid insecticides, were submitted to the US Environmental Protection Agency and obtained by Greenpeace after a freedom of information request.</p> <p>Neonicotinoids are the world\u2019s most widely used insecticides and there is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/28/strong-consensus-that-neonicotinoids-harm-bees-analysis-shows\">clear scientific evidence that they harm bees</a> at the levels found in fields, though only a little to date showing the pesticides harm the overall performance of colonies.

Although the colony was artificially provided with a spiked sugar solution, the bees were allowed to forage freely in the environment, so there is less stress - which can be a contributing variable - than if they were completely confined to cages.

They bred on horse-dung heaps, dark swarms of them. Without fridges, or cling-film, to keep them at bay, flies flew from open privies into milk jugs and bowls of sugar, and clustered on fruit, bread and raw meat. Some people hung up sticky flypaper in kitchens to trap them, and others had \u201csafes\u201d made from wire gauze to protect food, but not everyone bothered.<strong> </strong>In 1903, a medical officer for Brighton observed a poor home where the flies had to be \u201cpicked out of the half-empty can of condensed milk\u201d.<strong> </strong>In many kitchens, the presence of flies was so familiar as to seem harmless. But these insects were killers.</p> <p>It was only in the early 1900s that British doctors realised that the housefly could carry disease on its bristly legs: flies were a major transmitter of both typhoid and summer-sickness, causing thousands of deaths each year. After the hot summer of 1911, there was also rising public panic about the high levels of infant mortality from diarrhoea. Medical officers decided that they needed to change the way the British public felt about flies. As one expert in preventive medicine put it in 1914, people needed to know that the fly was \u201ca loathsome, dangerous pest\u201d.</p> <p>The problem was that the general population was simply not disgusted enough by flies. People tolerated them because they had no way of conceiving the harm they could do.</p> <p>There followed \u2013 from 1911 onwards \u2013 a vigorous anti-fly campaign of posters and community outreach, spearheaded by the Natural History Museum. The campaign was explicitly based not just on information but on the \u201ccreation of disgust\u201d, as historian Anne Hardy, of the London School of Tropical Medicine, describes it. The anti-fly posters were fearlessly graphic. Some of the images \u2013 displayed in schools, hospitals, municipal halls \u2013 depicted flies on bowls of milk, on pools of vomit and on rubbish heaps. But the main theme, Hardy noted, was very detailed images of \u201cflies sitting on shit\u201d. So much for Edwardian propriety. The anti-fly campaign \u2013 reinforced by medical officers spreading the message to mothers and children in local communities \u2013 was designed to trigger feelings of revulsion. It worked: the campaign definitely changed people\u2019s feeling about flies. It didn\u2019t stop infant diarrhoea overnight, but it was one of the reasons that the death rate from diarrhoea fell steadily from 1913 onwards. The anti-fly campaign saved lives.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>You can\u2019t mistake the look</strong> of disgust: a wrinkling of the nose and slight protrusion of the lips, as if trying to expel an offensive odour, as Charles Darwin observed in 1872. This visceral emotion is one of the main drivers of human behaviour. We recoil from the rotten, the stinking or anything that reminds us too strongly of death. This being so, disgust seems an obvious emotion to enlist in the cause of public health. In 2004, the British Heart Foundation triggered a big rise in calls to its helplines after showing ads featuring repulsive images of cigarettes oozing with fat. In 2012, Australia went even further, introducing cigarette packets with gruesome photos of gangrenous toes and diseased lungs, which seem to have achieved the objectives of making smokers enjoy smoking less and become more likely to quit.</p> <p>But disgust has seldom been called on to improve diets or hygiene. In the modern world, individuals are often disgusted by things that might do us good \u2013 such as liver and leftovers \u2013 and not disgusted by things \u2013 such as unwashed hands and sugary drinks \u2013 that do us harm. Disgust can still be a matter of life and death but it doesn\u2019t seem to be working for us any more.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e876e1383d903cf503fecd6cf2279681f0732fea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e876e1383d903cf503fecd6cf2279681f0732fea/0_0_3516_5100/689.jpg\" alt=\"A US public health poster from 1944.\" width=\"689\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A US public health poster from 1944.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Universal History Archive/UIG via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is a puzzle, given that many scientists now believe that the original function of disgust for humans was simply to keep us healthy. After years of studying hygiene behaviour in Asia, Africa and Europe, Professor Valerie Curtis, the director of the Hygiene Centre at the London School of Tropical Medicine, noticed a common thread to the things that people found revolting: \u201cThe odorous, the grubby, the leftover, the discarded.\u201d Everywhere, the single thing most likely to trigger disgust was faeces. After that came \u2013 among other things \u2013 animals, insects, dirt, pus, snot, hair and blood. It struck Curtis that all of these are carriers of parasites or disease \u2013 or proxies for those carriers. Disgust, Curtis decided, must have been an adaptive mechanism to prevent humans from coming in contact with infection. As she argued in her short book <a href=\"http://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/D/bo9186317.html\">Don\u2019t Look, Don\u2019t Touch, Don\u2019t Eat: The Science Behind Revulsion</a>, humans have evolved to be \u201cdisgustable\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cEmotions are the key to changing people\u2019s behaviour,\u201d Curtis told me one afternoon, speaking from her office in Bloomsbury. \u201cIt\u2019s not education that will do it. It\u2019s not knowledge. Disgust is the obvious emotion you can call on in public health. If you want a child to stop touching poo, you don\u2019t talk to them, you just pull a face.\u201d</p> <p>The creation of disgust around flies, according to Hardy, was <a href=\"www.historyandpolicy.org/policy-papers/papers/food-poisoning-an-on-going-saga\">a major achievement of the early 20th century</a>. The question is why disgust is not called upon more to solve modern health problems. Take handwashing. A <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/news/2010/09September/Pages/hygiene-washing-your-hands.aspx\">2010 study found that, when swabbed, 28% of UK commuters</a> had faecal bacteria on their hands. Washing with soap and water after going to the toilet and before eating is the single best way to reduce rates of gastrointestinal illness, yet estimates by the Lancet in 2003 suggested that fewer than one in five people in the world actually do it. Many in the developing world have no access to soap and running water \u2013 or toilets, come to that \u2013 but in cities such as London, where all the necessaries are abundant, hand-washing rates are still very low. This has consequences. There are more than a million cases of food poisoning a year in Britain. When we get sick, we are likely to blame it on someone else\u2019s cooking: a dodgy curry, an iffy prawn. Yet around a third of cases of gastrointestinal illness could be prevented through observing basic hand hygiene.</p> <p>Anne Hardy sometimes watches people in department store loos \u2013 the kind equipped with deliciously scented hand wash and jet dryers. She is startled by the number of women who exit a cubicle, look in the mirror, then rush straight out. \u201cMaybe they don\u2019t make the connection. They don\u2019t think there are germs on the door and on the sink.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHave you washed your hands?\u201d I bark at my children every night before we eat. Each time, they react with fresh consternation, as if I am weird. I never bothered so much with hand hygiene myself, until a few years ago, when researching an article on food poisoning. What I discovered made me queasy at the sight of multiple grubby hands passing round a single block of parmesan cheese. For me, it now feels uncomfortable not washing my hands before eating. Growing up, though, handwashing happened, if at all, after a meal. My mother worried more about stickiness than germs.</p> <p>The British generally have very low levels of disgust about both unwashed hands and poor kitchen hygiene. There\u2019s a robust pride in eating a slice of toast that\u2019s only been on the floor five seconds and not being one of those fussy people who carries antibacterial hand gel (and besides, a bit of dirt is good for the immune system, isn\u2019t it?). Obviously, you wouldn\u2019t want to become compulsive about handwashing, but most of the British population is very far from this. Food poisoning \u2013 most of it caused by faecal bacteria from unwashed hands \u2013 costs the UK economy nearly \u00a31.5bn a year. A 2003 study found that Britons suffer to a greater extent from traveller\u2019s diarrhoea than Americans, Australians or Europeans.</p> <p>One evening recently, Hardy, who is half-Danish, met friends for a meal after work and noticed that even though most of them had been on public transport,<strong> </strong>almost everyone sat down and started crumbling bread straight away. Some people make a point of washing their hands after going on public transport, but such habits are still exceptional. If you spread germs by spitting in the street, everyone knows about it. But the act of non-handwashing, Hardy notes, is \u201cquickly and discreetly achieved\u201d.</p> <p>Rates of handwashing in Britain don\u2019t seem to have improved since the second world war, when Lord Woolton urged the general public that handwashing after using the toilet would reduce food poisoning. There are notices, particularly in restaurant toilets, that say \u201cNow Wash Your Hands\u201d, but Hardy is convinced that nobody pays any attention to them. The majority of humans \u2013 in Britain and elsewhere \u2013 are not disgusted by their own fingers, no matter where they have been. We think about them as the late Victorians thought about flies: hardly at all. We spend a fortune on deodorant and mouthwash to create an aura of \u201cfreshness\u201d, but neglect the basic soap and water that might prevent us getting sick quite so often. But would the situation change if governments were bold enough to create graphic public health campaigns centred on disgust? And if they did, would we find them too offensive to look at?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7b96a1c90e1483afe8c6ed87187d772af0b3e367\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b96a1c90e1483afe8c6ed87187d772af0b3e367/0_81_5500_3302/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018For me, it now feels uncomfortable not washing my hands before eating.

Our ideas of disgusting food are very culturally specific. \u201cWhy will the Chinese eat rotten eggs, the Swiss rotten milk, and the Ugandans grasshoppers?\u201d she asks. Curtis\u2019s answer is that all foods are \u201cpotentially disgusting, but we make exceptions for what is familiar\u201d. If we grow up seeing others crunching on grasshoppers, we feel reassured that they are not something disease-ridden. \u201cIn every society infants accept what their mothers feed them \u2026 but novel foods are treated with suspicion, to be rejected, sniffed at, or tasted only in small bites.\u201d</p> <p>If this is true, why are we not more disgusted by foods that cause us harm? From January to March this year, analysis showed that about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/may/28/supermarket-chickens-contaminated-campylobacter\">79% of the chicken for sale in Britain was contaminated</a> with campylobacter, a bacterium responsible for an estimated 280,000 UK cases a year of a particularly vile form of food poisoning, and approximately 100 deaths. Yet somehow, most of the population remains undisgusted by mass-produced chicken. People look at it and see nothing but \u201cwhite meat\u201d: something safe and protein-rich, served up in neat portions, in an apparently sterile plastic tray. As Curtis comments, \u201cthey take away the feathers and the shit and make it look like a pure thing\u201d. Your senses do not tell you that this contains pathogens. \u201cWe need to listen to some kinds of disgust and not others,\u201d Curtis says, but in the modern world, it is increasingly hard for our brains to learn the difference.</p> <p>For years, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) has been trying to raise British awareness of campylobacter, and to persuade the public to cook chicken scrupulously and wash chopping boards and hands in hot water after touching raw poultry. For years, consumers have been resolutely ignoring these earnest pleas. But perhaps the anti-campylobacter message has been far too safe and rational. It doesn\u2019t push our disgust button. Just last year, the FSA ran a \u201cChicken Challenge\u201d, urging the public to \u201cbe careful\u201d and make an online pledge to \u201chelp cut campylobacter food poisoning in half\u201d by the end of the year \u2013 a meek and dull approach that did little to broadcast the true dangers. The hope was to change the way the whole country thought about cooking chicken but by August 2015, just six local councils and 3,521 individuals had signed up.</p> <p>Despite all the resources poured into the \u201cChicken Challenge\u201d campaign, the FSA was not brave enough to use disgust to make people think twice about eating poorly cooked chicken. A hard-hitting campaign linking explicit imagery of bloody diarrhoea with undercooked barbecued drumsticks might have done the job. \u201cBut the food industry would never let you do it,\u201d says Curtis. There are a lot of vested interests in the modern world, working to keep our disgust levels for certain things low. Supermarkets sell meat adorned with bucolic cows and sheep from prettily named farms, to stop us from thinking of the slaughterhouse. Adverts for female sanitary products show us innocuous blue liquid, nothing that threatens to make us think of menstrual blood.</p> <p>Disgust is an alarm system that we have become very good at switching off. It seems there would be no way for health campaigners to switch disgust back on again without upsetting a lot of people.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>In 2005, Jamie Oliver showed a classroom</strong> of schoolchildren how to manufacture chicken nuggets using grisly pink mechanically recovered meat, chicken skin, fat and additives, on an episode of Jamie\u2019s School Dinners. In another memorable scene from the programme, all of the junk food eaten by a single class of children at one school in a single day was piled up in a giant sugary, fatty refuse heap. Like the graphic anti-fly posters of the early 20th century, this disgusting imagery had an immediate, beneficial impact on public attitudes. Some criticised Oliver at the time for being so prescriptive, but his deliberate deployment of disgust was one of the factors leading to the adoption of more rigorous standards for UK school meals in 2006.</p> <p>If the Chicken Challenge\u2019s mild exhortation to \u201cbe careful\u201d didn\u2019t work, could food-related disgust be use more widely to help us adopt more healthy diets? Paul Rozin, an American psychologist, believes that it can. On a bright Saturday morning this July, Rozin told a rapt audience at the <a href=\"http://www.oxfordsymposium.org.uk/\">Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery</a> his solution to rising obesity: make fast food restaurants serve pre-chewed food. He was joking, but not entirely. Rozin\u2019s point is that provoking nausea is a much quicker and more effective way to stop someone eating something than simply telling them it is not healthy. One of Rozin\u2019s many experiments found that you can kill a person\u2019s appetite for sweets \u2013 temporarily, at least \u2013 if you offer them a box of chocolates with a small bite taken out of each one. \u201cThese don\u2019t sell!\u201d says Rozin.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"61e6af916fd969d7e458e74f5c294e82ccd8287c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61e6af916fd969d7e458e74f5c294e82ccd8287c/0_0_3466_2079/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A colour enhanced scanning electron micrograph of the bacteria Campylobacter.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A colour-enhanced scanning electron micrograph of the bacteria Campylobacter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rozin, who is 80, has a gravelly voice full of wry humour and seems very comfortable in his own skin (when on Skype, he does not always wear a top, as I discovered one morning when he spoke to me bare-chested, propped up against a red pillow in bed, during a trip to Barcelona). For four decades, he has been trying to unravel the meaning of disgust. No one since Darwin has added so much to our knowledge of this paradoxical emotion. Rozin was the dominant scholar in disgust studies before the evolutionary biologists entered the field, and he doesn\u2019t buy Valerie Curtis\u2019s theory that disgust was originally an adaptation to keep us safe from pathogens. To Rozin, this emotion is something far messier and more complex than basic microbe-avoidance.</p> <p>\u201cIf people were so predisposed [to avoid pathogens] you\u2019d think it would be easy to wash their hands after they defecate,\u201d he says. \u201cBut they don\u2019t.\u201d On his reading, disgust is basically about food, rather than pathogens. Disgust, for Rozin, is about avoiding more than simply disease. A fully developed sense of disgust does not appear until somewhere between the ages of two and five. In the 1980s, he found that very young children were often happy to drink a glass of apple juice which had a dead cockroach dropped in it and then removed. For most adults, by contrast, the cockroach rendered the juice undrinkable because it left them feeling that the juice was permanently contaminated. It didn\u2019t matter how much Rozin reassured them that the cockroach was sterile and safe. Most people didn\u2019t even want to drink fresh juice from the same glass when the \u201croached juice\u201d was poured away. The glass itself seemed to be crawling.</p> <p>It is Rozin\u2019s theory that disgust is, at root, a response to situations that remind us how close we are to being animals. \u201cAlmost all disgusting food is of animal origin.\u201d To some children, unfamiliar green vegetables may provoke distaste \u2013 the fear that something will taste bad \u2013 but disgust is something more. We don\u2019t care whether rat meat tastes bad (though I suspect it would), we just don\u2019t want it in our mouth. \u201cA basic feature of disgusting foods,\u201d Rozin has said, \u201cis that if they contact an otherwise desirable food, they render it inedible.\u201d A key element of disgust is contagion.</p> <p>Where Rozin agrees with Curtis, however, is that generating useful forms of disgust would be a potent way to change unhealthy behaviour.</p> <p>There is a huge amount at stake here, given that poor diets now cause more death and disease in the world than tobacco (10% as against 6.3% as of 2010). Instead of telling us that sugar-sweetened drinks are delicious treats that we must try very hard to resist, what would happen if governments tried to make us see them \u2013 like Edwardian houseflies \u2013 as \u201cloathsome, dangerous pests\u201d? \u201cI think these drinks are disgusting,\u201d says Curtis. Selling them to children is \u201cchild abuse\u201d. In 2009, New York City launched a deliberately nauseating ad campaign depicting globs of human fat pouring from a cola bottle. \u201cAre you pouring on the pounds?\u201d was the tagline. Consumption of sweetened fizzy drinks dropped by 12% in the city after the campaign.</p> <p>During my teenage years, the smell of fast food was like catnip. I knew it was bad for me, but that didn\u2019t stop me wanting it. Over time, my tastes changed and I started to find that burger-smell revolting: that sweetish meaty stench, the oiliness of the fries. It is no hardship to go without something when it turns your stomach.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b2aea67e5578240c82cc7daa9af4c67ee26eb245\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2aea67e5578240c82cc7daa9af4c67ee26eb245/0_201_3880_4849/800.jpg\" alt=\"An illustration from 1912.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An illustration from 1912.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Recruiting this strange, dark emotion to the cause of public health is not without problems, though. The danger \u2013 and this may explain why modern policy-makers are often reluctant to dabble with disgust \u2013 is hitting the wrong target. It\u2019s one thing to say that fattening foods and drinks are disgusting; quite another to attach disgust to the people who consume them. Many obese people already suffer from a debilitating sense of self-disgust and anything adding to the stigma would be damaging and counter-productive.</p> <p>When turned into a moral emotion, disgust can assume an ugly face. It has been demonstrated that some people have a disgust response not just to earthworms and spoiled milk but to those who are sick, elderly or disabled. Curtis has seen in Africa and Asia how quickly certain groups of people can be treated as dirty or untouchable. \u201cWe want people to wash their hands but we don\u2019t want to stigmatise those who have no access to a toilet,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Curtis was once involved in trying to develop a pro-breastfeeding campaign in the developing world. The aim was to make mothers feel disgusted about formula milk, whose use contributes to infant mortality in communities without access to clean water. \u201cThey should be disgusted,\u201d Curtis says. \u201cWe know that there are high concentrations of faecal bacteria in the milk,\u201d which comes from the water used to dissolve the milk powder. \u201cBut some mothers have to bottle-feed and we don\u2019t want to make them feel disgusting.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>No one wants to be made</strong> to feel disgusting, which is perhaps why there is such reluctance to call on disgust to change people\u2019s behaviour. But Curtis argues that, if it produces the desired change in people\u2019s behaviour, we should have no qualms about provoking powerful emotion. In Britain, the consequences of unwashed hands may be a nasty stomach bug. In the developing world, it is often death. It has been estimated that handwashing with soap, if it became a universal habit, could save 600,000 lives a year.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We retain faith in the power of facts to change behaviour, but what motivates us above all else is emotion</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One of the reasons people are not disgusted by unwashed hands is that they can\u2019t see the germs. \u201cDisgust only works when it\u2019s salient,\u201d says Paul Rozin, meaning that you have to notice something before you can be disgusted by it. Curtis and colleagues worked with a Ghanaian advertising agency to bring home the idea that faeces is still present on the hands even when you don\u2019t see it. They designed a TV commercial showing a nice-looking young mother leaving a toilet and preparing food for her kids, using her hands to knead dough. The film showed her with a smear of purple on her hands from the toilet.<strong> </strong>In the film, the purple passed from the mother\u2019s hands to the food to the child\u2019s mouth. When Curtis showed the first cut of the ad to mothers in Accra, she heard a sharp intake of breath and saw horror on their faces as they realised that faeces was being fed to children. \u201cIt didn\u2019t need words,\u201d Curtis says.</p> <p>As a society, we retain faith in the power of facts to change behaviour, despite ample evidence that what motivates us above all else is emotion. Disgust will often get the job done far quicker than information. When devising the handwashing advert in Ghana, Curtis knew that she simply had to make mothers see that they were \u201cfeeding their children poo\u201d. It took her British team of researchers a long time to come up with purple as the colour the audience would find most creepy on the mother\u2019s hands. The ad was extraordinarily effective. It was shown on Ghana\u2019s three national TV channels for a year. A nationwide survey suggested that eight to 10 months into the campaign, handwashing with soap had gone up by 41% before eating and 13% after using the toilet.</p> <p>In theory, rich countries could also try to sicken people into more hygienic behaviour. In 2007, researchers in Sydney placed some graphic posters in two washrooms, depicting a long bread roll filled with faeces. These revolting images were placed above the sinks and in the cubicles. Over a six-week period, the washrooms decorated with excrement sandwiches got through more soap and paper towels than a couple of control washrooms featuring posters showing clean hands and a bland informative message about disease prevention.</p> <p>There are downsides, however, to making people feel more disgusted than they already do. Shocking images on cigarette packets are one thing, because no one has to smoke. But everyone uses the toilet, and forcing people who already wash their hands to look at sickening pictures seems unfair. As it is, we are already far too disgusted by many things. There is such a thing as too much disgust, when it comes to health.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>When home cooks neglect</strong> to wash their hands after handling raw chicken heaving with campylobacter, the problem is that they are not disgusted enough. But there are cases where we are too disgusted to do things that might have public health benefits. Drinking recycled wastewater is an example. With climate change and increasing scarcity, finding new sources of drinkable water is a pressing concern. But that might be the easy part. Persuading people to drink it is another matter.</p> <p>In 2008, in drought-ridden Orange County, California, engineers set up a plant converting sewage water into drinking water. The water passed through a number of filters and purifiers until it was perfectly clean and pathogen-free. But local officials found that the \u201cyuck factor\u201d from residents was too great to put this water in taps, so most of it was pumped into the ground, to fill up aquifers. When surveyed, much of the population said that drinking the recycled water directly would be like sipping straight from the toilet. As one of Rozin\u2019s colleagues, Carol Nemeroff, asks: \u201cHow do you get the cognitive sewage out, after the actual sewage is gone?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2014/oct/30/-sp-how-insects-could-feed-the-world\">How insects could feed the world | Emily Anthes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The most effective way to make people get over their disgust about wastewater, Rozin says, would be to put it in the taps without telling anyone, wait a few months and then say: \u201cGuess what? You\u2019ve been drinking sewage water!\u201d The catch, he sees, is that it wouldn\u2019t be considered ethical to lie to people in this way. Rozin would like California to emulate Singapore, where people are invited to go on tours of the plants that recycle the water as a way of reassuring them how trustworthy the process is. At the end of the tour, each visitor gets a free bottle of the water, which looks like mineral water.</p> <p>The main way to overcome disgust is through repeated positive exposure.</p> <p>It\u2019s generally harder to eliminate disgust than it is to acquire it in the first place \u2013 Curtis calls it a \u201csticky\u201d emotion \u2013 but our sense of what is disgusting is far from fixed. A generation ago, the concept of raw fish seemed alien and slightly repugnant to many in the west. Now, sushi is the 10th favourite food among Americans (according to Globescan 2011) and sold as casually as sandwiches in British supermarkets.</p> <p>In fact, changing the foods that disgust us could be a crucial element in feeding rising populations. Canadian food writer Jennifer McLagan \u2013 author of Odd Bits, a celebration of offal \u2013 is on a mission to try to persuade cooks to be less disgusted by blood, which she regards as a sustainable form of animal protein. Because of the way meat is produced, the world, McLagan notes, is \u201cawash\u201d with this excellent source of protein and iron, but most of it gets wasted. Some is dumped into rivers and lakes, which causes pollution, increasing the nitrogen in the water. The key to avoiding this pollution \u2013 and getting some cheap nutrients into the bargain \u2013 would be eliminating our disgust for cooking with blood. McLagan finds pig\u2019s blood a marvellous substitute for eggs, with half the calories. In her Toronto kitchen, she whips fresh blood into a stable pink foam, which she uses for anything from rich brownies to dark brown blood meringues. I tried some of both. They tasted good, with a slight metallic tang. But most western consumers find the very idea of handling blood too horrifying even to contemplate.</p> <p>In harsh economic times, people may find themselves forced to swallow their disgust for certain foods. Consider insects. Environmentalists are now touting insects as one solution to the problem of finding a more sustainable source of animal protein. Me? I think eating insects is a great idea, so long as someone else does the eating. But Rozin has found that many insect-haters would get over their disgust, if only they could be persuaded to try them enough times \u2013 a similar reaction to that which many westerners have to sushi.</p> <p>Last year, Rozin and a colleague called Matt Ruby interviewed 400 people from India and the United States about how they felt about eating insects. Women, they found, were less willing than men to try insects, particularly in the US. Indians worried that eating insects was wrong, while Americans worried they were unhygienic. But most of those questioned said they would try insects if they were ground into flour and used to fortify a cookie or a dosa. Only 25 to 30% of those questioned still held out against eating insects even in this mild and unobtrusive form. The people most open to eating insects were thrill-seekers who described themselves as enjoying adventurous flavours.</p> <p>Disgust may be a universal emotion, but we vary hugely in how strongly we feel it, and what our triggers are. Each of us fall somewhere on what Rozin calls the \u201cdisgust sensitivity scale\u201d, a system he devised with another psychologist, Jonathan Haidt. You get an overall disgust rating based on how bothered you are by a range of triggers. These include:</p> <blockquote> <p>You see someone put ketchup on vanilla ice cream, and eat it.<br>You see maggots on a piece of meat in an outdoor garbage pail.<br>You see someone accidentally stick a fishing hook through his finger.<br>You are about to drink a glass of milk when you smell that it is spoiled.<br>You are walking barefoot on concrete and you step on an earthworm.</p> </blockquote> <p>For those who are lower down on this scale, it should be fairly easy to reduce or eliminate disgust for something like eating blood or insects \u2013 particularly with the right incentives. Rozin has found that a financial reward will often make someone swallow their disgust for certain things. If insects were cheap, familiar, and marketed in appetising ways, many people would gradually shed their disgust and greet them with pleasure. Or we could just wait until a crisis some time in the future when food is scarce and we become grateful for all the crickets and pig\u2019s blood we can get.</p> <p>The real puzzle is why most of us are disgusted by insects and offal, and not by other meat \u2013 mass-produced bacon, say \u2013 even though we know it is produced in conditions of cruelty and squalor. If governments were really determined to get rich populations to eat less meat \u2013 something that every expert on sustainable diets says needs to happen, and urgently \u2013 they would send schoolchildren to visit slaughterhouses instead of farms. It should be possible to generate mass disgust about unsustainable levels of meat eating, until a kebab seems as unappetising as a pile of crickets. The question is whether, as a society, we would ever want to. Like the rest of us, most politicians seem happy to carry on eating bacon sandwiches and pretending nothing is wrong.</p> <p>We are now so \u201cdisgustable\u201d that we have become squeamish about disgust itself. We live in a sanitised environment that hides from us the extent to which we still live with pathogens and other dangers to our health. Maybe the real reason we don\u2019t use disgust more in the cause of public health \u2013 despite all the evidence that it would work \u2013 is simply because it grosses us out even to think about it. Valerie Curtis was once booked to speak at a conference on \u201cself-neglect\u201d, about people who become isolated and abused, owing to a lack of basic hygiene. There was so little interest that the conference was cancelled. Even if it might help us to lead healthier lives, we would rather leave the whole topic of disgust in a dark place under a rock, with all the other creepy-crawlies.</p> <p><em>Bee Wilson is the author of First Bite: How We Learn to Eat (Fourth Estate)</em></p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\">@gdnlongread</a>, or sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/jul/20/sign-up-to-the-long-read-email\">here</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 28 July 2016 to correct a reference to \u201ca bacteria\u201d.</p>", "wordcount": "5153"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "news/2016/oct/16/corrections-and-clarifications", "type": "article", "sectionId": "news", "sectionName": "News", "webPublicationDate": "2016-10-16T19:59:43Z", "webTitle": "Corrections and clarifications", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/oct/16/corrections-and-clarifications", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2016/oct/16/corrections-and-clarifications", "fields": {"byline": "Corrections and clarifications column editor", "body": "<p>\u2022 We confused flora (plants) and fauna (animals) when we described a beekeeper going through \u201cthe fauna here that provides a happy hunting ground for the bees\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/08/walking-into-the-unknown-rural-england-weighs-up-the-reality-of-brexit\" title=\"\">Walking into the unknown: rural England ponders life after Brexit</a>, 8 October, page 17).</p> <p>\u2022 The director of the 1915 film The Birth of a Nation is DW Griffith, not DW Griffiths as we had it because of an editing error (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/12/hollywood-truth-better-fiction-birth-of-nation-nat-turner\" title=\"\">Hollywood, sometimes the truth is better than fiction</a>, 13&#xa0;October, page 35).</p> <p>\u2022 After we referred to Battle as \u201cthe village in East Sussex that owes its origin and name to the most famous battle in English history\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/oct/14/battle-of-hastings-rage-again-re-enactors-celebrate-anniversary\" title=\"\">Harold ready for an eyeful at battle to mark 1066 anniversary</a>, 14 October, page 5), a reader pointed out that it is not a village but a market town.</p>", "wordcount": "133"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "artanddesign/2017/oct/29/bloomberg-hq-city-of-london-norman-foster-review", "type": "article", "sectionId": "artanddesign", "sectionName": "Art and design", "webPublicationDate": "2017-10-29T08:00:22Z", "webTitle": "Bloomberg European HQ review \u2013 welcome to the Bloombergeum\u2026", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/oct/29/bloomberg-hq-city-of-london-norman-foster-review", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/oct/29/bloomberg-hq-city-of-london-norman-foster-review", "fields": {"byline": "Rowan Moore", "body": "<p>What, you might ask, when walking around <a href=\"https://www.fosterandpartners.com/projects/bloomberg/\">Bloomberg\u2019s new headquarters</a> in the City of London, are these giant cabbage leaves, these water-washed organisms surging from below, these invaders from 1950s sci-fi, doing in the pavement?

And wouldn\u2019t you know it, the sun was even shining. I was attending <a href=\"http://www.gardeningscotland.com/\">Gardening Scotland</a>, and if there\u2019s one thing you can be assured of this far north, it\u2019s that usually the weather does not cooperate. I\u2019d expected horizontal rain. Today however luck was on my side; it was a beautiful day.</p> <p>Gardening Scotland is billed as the largest horticultural show north of the border. The annual event is held at The <a href=\"http://www.royalhighlandcentre.co.uk/\">Royal Highland Centre</a> which is, ironically, just outside of Edinburgh. On the day I attended, cheering my good fortune and the golden sunshine, I was excited to see what Scotland had to offer. I knew it\u2019d be a more local, laid back affair. I didn\u2019t expect to see too many Panama hats or stiletto heels. I was wearing jeans.</p> <p>As I entered, I picked up a programme and flicked through the glossy pages \u2013 show gardens, floral hall, plant sales, RHS theatre, doughnut stalls and coffee \u2013 I really didn\u2019t know what to do first. I was shaken back to reality by the mechanical roar of an aeroplane. The Royal Highland Centre sits adjacent to Edinburgh airport. Driving in, you can see the universal signs for arrivals and departures. It\u2019s an unfortunate location.</p> <p>I decided to head to the show gardens as a 757 crested over the crowds. An aeroplane thundering down the tarmac on its way to Majorca didn\u2019t really scream horticulture to me. I shrugged. Once I was inside the event grounds, I was too obsessed with the plants to really notice anything else.</p> <p><strong>The show gardens</strong></p> <p>Every year I watch the Chelsea flower show on the television and love looking at the show gardens. I know that Chelsea sits in a category all of its own. For example, the average price of a Chelsea show garden is <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13422963\">\u00a3250,000</a>, which can create warped expectations when visiting other events. It\u2019s understandable that pockets that deep don\u2019t exist elsewhere. I also believe in the adage that money isn\u2019t everything; small can also be beautiful. With this in mind, I felt hopeful as I neared the show gardens. </p> <p>I was not disappointed.</p> <p>The first garden I wandered through was the <a href=\"http://www.sruc.ac.uk/news/article/1609/sruc_students_buzzing_after_premier_gold_award_win_at_gardening_scotland\">Hive Jive garden</a> from SRUC (Scotland\u2019s Rural College) Edinburgh, which won the premier gold medal for 2016. The odd name had an explanation: it was inspired by the movement bees make as they return to the nest. Therefore, the design of the space had bees at its heart. Bees perform specific movements, similar to a figure of eight (a jive), in order to notify other bees of the best spots to find pollen. The garden also relied on hexagonal shapes in order to suggest the honeycombs the bees create. I liked the garden\u2019s use of box hedges which created formality, while generous lavender planting helped to soften the overall effect. Lavender is, of course, a sweet shop for bees. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"251eda954768a3ab22cbaaf1db0391a5039b6471\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/251eda954768a3ab22cbaaf1db0391a5039b6471/0_356_2002_2500/801.jpg\" alt=\"The Within These Walls garden won the people\u2019s choice award at Gardening Scotland\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Within These Walls garden won the people\u2019s choice award at Gardening Scotland</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Watts</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, my favourite garden was constructed by men from Glenochil prison in Alloa and women from Cornton Vale prison in Stirling. It was titled <a href=\"http://www.hortweek.com/bakkercom-sees-prison-garden-win-gardening-scotland/landscape/article/1398178\">Within These Walls \u2013 a Journey Inside</a>. The garden was a wonderful expression of the transformative effects of gardening. The garden was not only beautiful, but it was filled with testimonials of how gardening helped inmates of both prisons rebuild their lives. There were letters which spoke about inmates and their poor mental health, and how the garden helped to heal those who worked on it. The garden was obviously a hit with spectators \u2013 it received the People\u2019s Choice Award for the best show garden.</p> <p><strong>The floral h</strong><strong>all</strong></p> <p>I entered the floral hall in the early afternoon. It was busy. People swarmed the stalls and displays like carrot fly in midsummer. The entire place felt like a cavernous train station, but instead of people rushing to catch the 10.15 to Paris, they were scuttling here and there to grab a glimpse of a peony or a lupine.</p> <p>There were several local nurseries which had lovely displays. In my opinion however, all the stall holders offered something even more precious than plants: they offered advice. Local knowledge is always the best knowledge, and while books often talk in sweeping generalisations, people can answer specific questions. Seed packets are a perfect example. Sowing courgettes in April might be fine in Southern England, but good luck in the Highlands of Scotland. When it comes to shrubs and herbaceous perennials, it can get even more complex. For me, it was great to see a so many local growers exchanging information relevant to their part of the country. <a href=\"http://www.binnyplants.com/\">Binny Plants</a>, for example, specialise in growing hardy perennials fit for the Scottish climate. There was also a great display by <a href=\"http://www.newhopetoungardens.co.uk/\">New Hopetoun Garden Centre</a> \u2013 I could have happily taken their entire stock home with me.</p> <p><strong>The Big Back Garden</strong></p> <p>I arrived looking for gardening inspiration and ideas. Importantly, I also arrived with my three and a half year old little girl who is constantly on the move. The event is advertised as a family-friendly, so I was putting that to the test. And this is where Gardening Scotland really shone.</p> <p>There was an entire space dedicated to keeping little folks happy, called the Big Back Garden. There were slides and play equipment, arts and crafts, face painting, as well as story book reading in a large central wigwam. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mairi_Hedderwick\">Mairi Hedderwick</a> even showed up to read from her well known Katie Morag books. My daughter loved it.</p> <p>It gave me a chance to sneak away to the plant stalls and do a bit of shopping. I found exactly what I was looking for: local plants suitable to local conditions. I was thrilled to find a dwarf delphinium called \u2018Highlander Crystal\u2019 grown by <a href=\"http://www.elmleaplants.co.uk/\">Elmlea Plants</a>. Scotland can be bracing at times, and plants often get flattened by winds; plants that don\u2019t need staking are always good. In addition, I was told this little plant was tougher than your average delphinium, and could better withstand the wet winter soil.</p> <p>Finding unique, or specialised items you otherwise didn\u2019t know existed is why I love attending events like Gardening Scotland. Whether it\u2019s a decorative piece of garden art, an unusual specimen plant, or a careful piece of advice, gardening events are a great place to find something special. Next year, I\u2019ll be bringing a bigger shopping bag.</p> <p><em> </em>\u2022 <em><a href=\"http://www.gardeningscotland.com/\">Gardening Scotland 2017</a> will take place from Friday 2nd to Sunday 4th, at The Royal Highland Centre, Edinburgh.</em></p>", "wordcount": "1099"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}, {"id": "uk-news/shortcuts/2016/nov/01/bomb-detecting-spinach-the-new-weapon-against-terrorist-plots", "type": "article", "sectionId": "uk-news", "sectionName": "UK news", "webPublicationDate": "2016-11-01T12:25:03Z", "webTitle": "Bomb-detecting spinach \u2013 the new weapon against terrorist plots", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/shortcuts/2016/nov/01/bomb-detecting-spinach-the-new-weapon-against-terrorist-plots", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/shortcuts/2016/nov/01/bomb-detecting-spinach-the-new-weapon-against-terrorist-plots", "fields": {"body": "<p><strong>Name:</strong> Bomb-detecting spinach.</p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> The cutting edge of military technology.</p> <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> It looks like spinach.</p> <p><strong>Hey, this sounds like an Eddie Izzard routine.</strong> Well, it isn\u2019t.

Could we make the best of this world, in true Theresa May fashion? Are animals, perhaps, all a bit overrated? Maybe it wouldn\u2019t be so bad?</p> <p>Sure, there would be some tough choices at first. One particularly pressing matter would be finding a way to cross-pollinate flowering crops. As is well known, trees and insects co-evolved, the plants offering a sugary reward to insects in return for their pollination services. How might we achieve this without bees and flies? Simple. The problem of cross-fertilisation could quite simply be solved by robots or people on day release from jail (or even children who don\u2019t get into grammar schools). They could be made to hand-fertilise flowers. They could be like little unthinking bees.</p> <p>Indeed, hand-fertilisation is already <a href=\"https://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/5193-Decline-of-bees-forces-China-s-apple-farmers-to-pollinate-by-hand\" title=\"\">common practice in some parts of the world</a>, where invertebrate populations have already been ravaged. Think of the savings of such a plan! Robots don\u2019t need sugary water produced by plants, after all. They run on cheap oil and gas, which there\u2019s plenty of, forever. Without invertebrates, everyone wins, right?</p> <p>More seriously, there could be other benefits. Think of climate change. Global emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> would be greatly reduced without them, seeing that the gas that sprouts forth from farm animals accounts for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/sep/26/greenhouse-gas-emissions-livestock\" title=\"\">15% of human-caused global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions</a>.

Pets can go. They <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/nov/13/ethical-living-carbon-emissions\" title=\"\">contribute to global emissions</a> as well. If we were to get rid of them, within two generations the very notion of having a pet would probably end up being absurd. The very idea that some houses had cats that would warm a person\u2019s lap while they watched Netflix could seem almost perverted to our great-great-grandchildren whose idea of having a meaningful relationship with an animal would, by then, involve tossing 35 <a href=\"http://www.t3.com/news/pok-mon-go-fans-now-you-can-get-a-real-working-pok-ball-that-doubles-as-a-charger\" title=\"\">Pok\u00e9balls</a> at an imaginary one while sitting on the toilet.</p> <p>It\u2019s not all rosy, however. I\u2019m the first to admit that there would be problems in a post-animal world. Sure, green algal blooms would cover the entire face of the planet \u2013 most of the land and sea \u2013 and all plants would remain uncropped and there would be the stench of scavenging fungus which would come to fill the niche left by Earth\u2019s animal decomposers. But we can handle a bit of a whiff or maybe get a man in to fix this for us or something. Oh, and the crops wouldn\u2019t grow because there would be no worms to oxygenate the soil. And the soil communities \u2013 tiny nematode worms and mites \u2013 would die so the soil would essentially be dead and likely to blow away, being completely unsuitable for any forms of crops. But \u2026 let\u2019s not get bogged down in the details, OK? Again, children and robots can probably fill this role. It\u2019ll be fine.</p> <p>For there is another bonus to living in a world without animals. It is simple. Imagine the ego-boost that would come from being the only animals to survive a mass extinction event. Imagine being the pinch point. You and me. We could be the masters of a mass extinction so enormous that all future life on Earth might be a descendent of us. Imagine, in 50m years, little rat humans and little pig humans and little humans that feast upon wetland grasses poisoned by a film of toxic bacteria. Imagine little fungus-eating humans, gorging upon the silent forests of stinking colourless mushrooms that thrive on rotting, uneaten trees. Imagine little cat humans that can warm your lap while watching Netflix. That sounds great, doesn\u2019t it? We could be surrounded by animals shaped in our own image. We could be gods, essentially.</p> <p>It may sound surreal, but conservationists, I believe, imagine this world quite a bit. They consider this human world, and what it would be like without animals in it. A silent world where it\u2019s all about us and what industry can do \u2013 where there\u2019s no escape from humanity. A world where the only sounds are human-made and the only colours are factory-made is not an Earthly place, to me at least.</p> <p>So perhaps it\u2019s time, finally, that we started considering the worst if only for a few moments every now and then. Perhaps it will make us listen that bit harder the next time statistics like these are published by conservationists. Because this is a real decline. This is a real trend. This is what mass extinctions look like from the inside. An animal world becoming less animal by the day. So, which world do you like best: ours or theirs?</p>", "wordcount": "911"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}, {"id": "environment/2017/may/12/uk-farmers-call-for-cross-country-pipelines-after-driest-winter-in-20-years-water-shortage-south-east", "type": "article", "sectionId": "environment", "sectionName": "Environment", "webPublicationDate": "2017-05-12T13:15:24Z", "webTitle": "UK farmers call for cross-country pipelines after driest winter in 20 years", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/12/uk-farmers-call-for-cross-country-pipelines-after-driest-winter-in-20-years-water-shortage-south-east", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/may/12/uk-farmers-call-for-cross-country-pipelines-after-driest-winter-in-20-years-water-shortage-south-east", "fields": {"byline": "Patrick Barkham", "body": "<p>Farmers are warning that water may have to be transferred across Britain after an unusually dry winter and spring left more than four-fifths of rivers with too little to support local growers.</p> <p>Fears of a drought were expected to ease this weekend as scattered showers usher in a more traditional British spring, but wildlife and agriculture industries are bracing for a long, parched summer. </p> <p>The driest winter for 20 years has hit particularly hard in the south-east, where forecasts for rain remain elusive in the coming week.

We might have to build a water shunting pipeline from Wales to London.\u201d</p> <p>John Breach, chairman of the <a href=\"http://www.bifga.org.uk/\">British Independent Fruit Growers Association</a>,  is calling for a government-funded water grid to be built alongside HS2 and other major new roads to carry water from the north-west to the south-east. </p> <p>\u201cAnywhere they build new motorways they should think ahead for once \u2013 pipelines could be added alongside and you\u2019re only paying for the cost of the pipes,\u201d he said.</p> <p>According to Clive Edmed, a fruit farmer in Kent, modern high-yielding apple trees require more water and are less resistant to drought than the larger-rooted old trees. Apples are likely to be smaller this year and the only consolation for growers such as Edmed is that he is unlikely to be competing with large scale imports \u2013 apple crops on the continent, including France, have also been decimated by drought and late frosts.</p> <p>Late frosts in the UK have also caused apple growers to lose all the blossom \u2013 and this year\u2019s fruit \u2013 in some orchards. \u201cWe\u2019ve got our backs to the wall on several fronts,\u201d said Edmed.</p> <p>Beyond the struggle to make a living this season, farmers in the parched south-east are investing millions in on-farm reservoirs to future-proof their growing of high-value \u2013 but thirsty \u2013 crops such as potatoes and carrots.<br></p> <p>The 2,530-hectare (6,250-acre) <a href=\"http://www.eustonhall.co.uk/The-Farm_12699.html\">Euston estate</a> in Suffolk has spent \u00a3800,000 on two reservoirs which hold 200m gallons of water and \u00a31.2m on laying an underground irrigation main to distribute the water to its fields.</p> <p>The farm has enough water to survive a one-and-a-quarter year drought, but even now does not have enough water to irrigate its cereal crops. According to Andrew Blenkiron, the estate\u2019s director, the dry spring will reduce the farm\u2019s wheat and barley yields by 20%, with further losses if the drought intensifies.</p> <p>\u201cIf the river flows continue to be low this summer and we move into a really dry winter we won\u2019t be able to fill our reservoirs,\u201d said Blenkiron. \u201cThe ability to irrigate crops is going to be vitally important in the future. We need to simplify the planning system so we can build these storage reservoirs and come up with some kind of financial incentive such as tax-breaks to help pay for these massive capital items.\u201d</p> <p>Many smaller farms cannot afford to build reservoirs but an increasing number of farmers are seeking to build up organic matter in their soils so they better store moisture and do not erode in dry weather. </p> <p>\u201cThis is the long game,\u201d said Blenkiron. \u201cIt\u2019s probably not my lifetime but my successor\u2019s lifetime \u2013 building organic matter with lots of animal manures. Lots of farmers are really enlightened now and focused on this.\u201d</p> <p>Across the country, catchment partnerships involving local farmers, water companies and environmental organisations, are taking similar \u201csensible and pragmatic measures\u201d to slow the movement of water through the landscape, according to Henri Brocklebank of <a href=\"https://sussexwildlifetrust.org.uk\">Sussex Wildlife Trust</a>. \u201cWe\u2019re not pitched against farmers at all, we\u2019re all on the same team on this one.\u201d</p> <p>While the dry weather is challenging human ingenuity, there are winners as well as losers in the natural world.</p> <p>\u201cThe dry spell is doing far more good than harm for wildlife and long may it continue because the last time we had a decent summer was 2006,\u201d said Matthew Oates of the <a href=\" https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/\">National Trust</a>. Recent wet summers have caused long, rank grass and bracken to swamp many heat-loving species. </p> <p>\u201cThe main beneficiaries of drier weather are the myriad of plants and animals which like pockets of bare ground, because that\u2019s been closed over in recent years. Insects such as mining bees really benefit from having barer ground and have for once been doing really well,\u201d he said. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.britishhedgehogs.org.uk/\">British Hedgehog Preservation Society</a> is calling on gardeners to put out shallow dishes of water for parched hedgehogs.

Famous athletes in a wide range of sports are forsaking meat and appear to be having a big impact on the number of people trying a plant-based diet.</p> <p>Some of the world\u2019s leading footballers, including Barcelona\u2019s Lionel Messi and Manchester City\u2019s Sergio Ag\u00fcero, do not eat meat during the playing season, while England striker Jermaine Defoe has gone a big step further by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/mar/27/jermain-defoe-england-striker-lithuania\" title=\"\">taking up a vegan diet</a>. Wimbledon finalist Venus Williams, an Italian rugby international, a US Olympic weightlifter, a number of hulking American football players, former heavyweight world champion David Haye, two snooker world champions and several top Australian cricketers are also on the vegan list.</p> <p>Other sports with top-level vegans are wrestling, surfing, cycling, ice hockey, parkour \u2013 the \u201cextreme gymnastics\u201d sport that may be added to the Olympic programme \u2013 squash, bobsleigh, mixed martial arts fighting and ultra-running.</p> <p>The surge had come in recent years, driven by digital media, said Vince. \u201cIt\u2019s a mixture of people looking for an edge to improve performance, greater prevalence of knowledge, and more scientific evidence about the benefits, not just in sports performance but for human health,\u201d he said.</p> <p>While Vince and the Vegan Society welcome the new wave of plant-powered sports stars, others are less happy because many are giving up meat for personal performance benefits, not because they are in tune with the vegan lifestyle and compassion for animals.</p> <p>But Dominika Piasecka, media officer for the Vegan Society, welcomed the sporting newcomers and predicted there would be more. The sports stars\u2019 influence \u201chas definitely helped to further the cause of veganism,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople really do take notice, especially if they\u2019re a fan of the person.\u201d</p> <p>The England-based Vegan Society, founded in 1944 when the movement began, is overseeing \u201cthe fastest-growing lifestyle movement of the 21st century\u201d. Its researchers put the number of vegans in Britain at 542,000 \u2013 up 260% in 10 years \u2013 and estimate that about 1% of the population in Britain, Germany and the US is vegan. \u201cIt is very likely that we will see an increase in the number of vegan sportspeople because more of them are starting to realise the benefits of a vegan diet,\u201d Piasecka said. Forest Green Rovers are \u201cbreaking stereotypes and helping people to associate veganism with health, fitness and wellbeing\u201d.</p> <p>Myths about the need to eat meat for protein have long since been disproved.</p> <p>An aristocratic real tennis player who won a silver medal at the London 1908 Olympic Games was an early promoter of vegetarianism in Britain. Eustace Miles, a philanthropist, wrote <em>Health Without Meat</em>, which was a bestseller for years after it was published in 1915.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"265894234f2374e9573c0798d90c56d906177abe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/265894234f2374e9573c0798d90c56d906177abe/66_55_3626_2177/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Haye\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Critics call boxer David Haye a \u2018Cheagan\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Walton/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A few years later Paavo Nurmi, the Finn who was a vegetarian from boyhood, would establish himself as the greatest middle- and long-distance runner of the20th century. He won nine Olympic golds.</p> <p>The Australian swimmer Murray Rose, nicknamed \u201cthe seaweed streak\u201d because he ate a lot of seaweed in his vegan diet, was 17 when he won three Olympic golds in 1956.</p> <p>In the television age Ed Moses, unbeaten for eight years at the 400m hurdles, and 100m world record holder Leroy Burrell were vegetarian, and the biggest name by far to adopt a vegan diet was Carl Lewis, the world\u2019s most famous sprinter before the chicken-nugget lover Usain Bolt came along. The notorious boxer Mike Tyson also adopted a plant-based diet after he quit the ring.</p> <p>But Lewis and Tyson stuck with it only for a few years and others may follow suit when their competing days are over.</p> <p>Forest Green\u2019s \u201cvegan club\u201d label is not what it seems. The players are not vegan, they simply have to eat plant-based meals at matches and training. No animal products are on sale at the stadium. \u201cWe don\u2019t check up on them away from the club but we hear that players are changing their approach [to their diet], and it happens with fans too,\u201d said Vince. \u201cJust doing these things and talking about it has an effect on everybody \u2013 players, fans, even the media.\u201d</p> <p>Venus Williams is widely seen, even by herself, as a \u201ccheagan\u201d, a cheating vegan who does not stick strictly to the lifestyle. A blogger on the <a href=\"http://www.ecorazzi.com/\" title=\"\">ecorazzi </a>website criticised Haye for using veganism as \u201cnothing but a vessel for self-promotion and adulation. For the sake of the animals \u2026 we should pay no attention, nor give any credence to the positions of these athletes who are interested in nothing but their own careers\u201d.</p> <p>But Vince believes this criticism is misguided. \u201cIt\u2019s a mistake to be too purist about it. What we want to do is get the interest of the general public, we want them to know that a plant-based diet is easily available to them. It has to be accessible.

If the vegan message is getting out there then that is a step in the right direction.</p> <p>\u201cThere is more awareness about veganism these days compared to when I was playing. I believe the vegan food industry is going to really expand in the next five years. It\u2019s very exciting.\u201d</p> <p>Brenda Carey, owner and editor of <em>Vegan Health and Fitness</em> magazine in the US, is more wary than welcoming. \u201cAs an idealist, I wish that everyone would choose to eat vegan to relieve the suffering of animals. I also wish that everyone would care enough about the environment to want to avoid animal products as the number one cause of environmental destruction on the planet.</p> <p>\u201cThere are many top vegan athletes who are vegan for these reasons \u2013 and yes, they get a performance boost. However, there are many high-profile vegan athletes who never mention anything but their personal, selfish benefits from avoiding animal products and eating more plants. We call those people \u2018plant-based\u2019 as they do not embrace a full vegan lifestyle, they just eat plants.</p> <p>\u201cI get concerned about the people who simply follow this behaviour because their favourite athlete or celebrity has done so. Unfortunately people who choose to \u2018go vegan\u2019, which often equates to merely eating plant-based, for selfish reasons such as performance benefits or weight loss, tend to be the ones who fall off the wagon and go back to eating animal products later.\u201d</p> <p>Carey is, though, a realist as well as an idealist, \u201cso I\u2019m just glad when anyone chooses to avoid eating animal products\u201d.</p> <p>The strongest sporting voice against uncommitted plant-eaters is Neil Robinson, who became the first vegan footballer in Britain, and, he thinks, the world. He played for Everton, Swansea and others in a 16-year career from 1974, and says football is still \u201cin the stone age\u201d for vegans.

It dilutes veganism into being just a diet when in fact veganism is an ethos, a lifestyle of non-violence and compassion towards all living creatures.</p> <p>\u201cFootball is still in the stone age when it comes to embracing veganism. Clubs these days employ \u2018qualified\u2019 nutritionists and it baffles me as to how these so-called experts can ignore the fact that animal foods are totally unnecessary for human health and, most importantly as far as they\u2019re concerned, sporting performance. Individual sportsmen and women are now \u2018getting it\u2019 but the clubs and authorities, with the exception of Forest Green Rovers, appear to be aeons away from embracing the plant food age.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps the best role model for plant-powered health is Fauja Singh, the 106-year-old runner who appeared alongside David Beckham in an advertising campaign and who ran the London marathon aged 101.

I\u2019ll never forget my first year in London: I had massive failures. The climate was really different: the tastes of my childhood, such as okra, just couldn\u2019t cope with the cold. I was intrigued by the concept of taking a more natural approach to growing food, so I studied permaculture.</p> <p>Along the journey I met my wife, Caroline. We moved to Devon with our son in 2014, where we now live in <a href=\"http://landmatters.org.uk/\">an off-grid community</a> set in 42 acres. I\u2019m specialising in how to use small spaces for intensive growing and self-sustainability, and teach introduction to permaculture courses and more specialist subjects, such as composting.</p> <p>When I lived in London, I helped set up <a href=\"http://www.mayproject.org/ \">May Project Gardens</a>, growing food and teaching people about nature. The disconnect that I noticed between those young people and nature was heartbreaking. I hope that my son will grow up to appreciate the wisdom that nature has to offer us.</p> <p>In my garden, you can find lots of examples of permaculture: companion planting, herb spirals, plants and edible flowers to attract insects and bees for pollination. One of my favourite plants is comfrey; I use it a lot to make liquid feed for plants. It also has beautiful flowers that the bees love, and amazing medicinal uses, too. I have it all over my garden.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/14/how-does-your-garden-grow-mark-lane\">Me and my garden: \u2018There\u2019s no reason why someone in a wheelchair cannot design beautiful gardens\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>My favourite spot</strong></h2> <p>I spend a lot of time sitting around the fire pit, observing the vastness of the land when the sun goes down.

Perhaps it is inevitable that peering through a microscope at dead insects in her London studio led her to the lanes of south Devon to create a meadow, and capture some of its richness in a series of artistic adventures.</p> <p>If you feel there\u2019s something familiar about the name, you\u2019d be right: Albarn is the younger sister of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/damon-albarn\">Damon of Blur</a>, and her meadow is on the old farm he bought for his family 20 years ago. \u201cI\u2019m lucky to have this antidote to London,\u201d she says. \u201cDamon bought this as a family place, so we could all have somewhere to meet. This work is part of him, because I wouldn\u2019t have had this otherwise. It\u2019s been wonderful.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9cccfaca2e078e0646bbf6e156ae254de93d28fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9cccfaca2e078e0646bbf6e156ae254de93d28fd/0_0_3024_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Spider, a drawing on paper.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spider ... a drawing on paper.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Albarn</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Albarn spent most of her childhood in rural Essex. Her dad, Keith, taught at Colchester School of Art. \u201cIt was great for me as a kid. We had a bit of freedom. You could walk to the woods and down to the river, and I had loads of animals. That\u2019s where it all began for me.\u201d Her mum came from a farming family in Lincolnshire and Albarn thinks a love of the land \u201cis also probably a bit in the blood\u201d.</p> <p>She took her art foundation course under her dad at Colchester (\u201cHe was great, but I had a bit of a hard time from some of the other staff\u201d) and moved to London to complete her degree. She was just getting going as an artist when she gave birth to her daughter, who is now 21, and she has an 18-year-old son. But just when she might have had more time to make art, she had another daughter, who is five. Some artists struggle to continue working with family and financial demands. Albarn has \u201cfought like crazy to keep going\u201d, she says. \u201cI\u2019ve been very dogged about it. Being a woman and having children, your career takes a different path. I didn\u2019t get the opportunity to do an MA, but I\u2019ve found my path \u2013 and it\u2019s made me very disciplined.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6d54acbc34eecdbf2c41968fd44b5ae1098b3323\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d54acbc34eecdbf2c41968fd44b5ae1098b3323/0_96_4211_2526/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The artist\u2019s meadow at Damon Albarn\u2019s farm in Devon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Field-good factor ... the artist\u2019s meadow at the family farm in Devon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Albarn</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She likes to go out on a forage, she says, and her art \u201cusually begins with something I find\u201d. She has been particularly inspired by bees, and undertook a \u201cbee marathon\u201d at the Natural History Museum, drawing bees all day in \u201chomage to their industry\u201d. She laughs. \u201cEveryone is going on about the bees dying, which is very tragic and depressing, so it is nice to try and do something positive.\u201d </p> <p>Albarn began raising money for the <a href=\"http://bumblebeeconservation.org/\">Bumblebee Conservation Trust</a> and learned of the importance of \u201ccreating corridors for wildlife and wild flowers\u201d. And that\u2019s when she decided to turn a small, steep south-facing sheep field into a meadow. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly lush down here and there\u2019s a lot of wild flowers, so my parents thought I was a bit mad when I said I wanted to create a meadow. But I hope to encourage two species in particular \u2013 <a href=\"https://bumblebeeconservation.org/about-bees/identification/very-rare/shrill-carder-bee/\">the shrill carder bumblebee</a> and the <a href=\"https://bumblebeeconservation.org/about-bees/identification/scarce/\">blaeberry bumblebee</a>. They are around in this area but they are very, very rare.\u201d</p> <p>Following advice from a BCT outreach officer, she created the meadow. \u201cAlthough I\u2019ve been studying insects for a long time, I\u2019m quite a novice and am learning as I go,\u201d she says. Much of her art mixes insects with geometrical forms and the meadow is marked out in six hexagon shapes \u2013 inspired by beeswax \u2013 arranged in a triangular shape. She and her mum collected as much local seed as they could find (locally sourced seed is always best for \u201cnew\u201d meadows) and bought extra BCT-approved native seeds, and scattered them over the slope.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1da4a23c907122fc268c9aacc389278b29ca82ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1da4a23c907122fc268c9aacc389278b29ca82ad/197_0_2239_2798/800.jpg\" alt=\"Albarn at the launch for her illustrated book, The Boy in the Oak.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018My parents thought I was mad\u2019 ...

It\u2019s a wonderful thing to watch.\u201d This is Albarn\u2019s second summer managing the meadow, and it is improving each year: crucially, yellow rattle is now established, a flower that is parasitic on grass and so creates more space for other flowers.<br></p> <p>It is a kind of artistic study plot. \u201cI wanted to create an archive, a piece of land that I could manage myself.

It just needs a healthy dose of sunshine and some time. As a gardener I will continue to prune, to shape, to help things along and weed things out where necessary - play God, if you like.

The bees need the flowers for food, while the flower needs the bee to reproduce. Unlike other insects, nectar and pollen from flowering plants are bees\u2019 only food source; the sweet nectar drink gives adult bees energy. Pollen is protein-rich baby food. As the poet Kahlil Gibran beautifully put it: \u201cTo the bee, a flower is the fountain of life, and to the flower, the bee is a messenger of love.\u201d</p> <p>In the process of foraging for food, bees are designed to pollinate. If you watch a female honeybee or bumblebee on a flower, you will see she has balls of pollen on her back legs. These are collected in her pollen baskets which she takes back to the nest to feed the young after fertilising the flowers. For solitary bees, the pollen collects on the hairs on their abdomen.</p> <p>So how do the bees pollinate? Quite simply, the bee gets covered in pollen, from the male part of the flower (the stamen), and deposit the grains on the female part (the stigma) of the next flower that they visit. Luckily for the plant, bees tend to visit flowers from the same plant when they are flowering rather than flit from one plant to another, so the plant is able to have sex. Once the pollen is on the stigma it moves down into the ovary where it fertilises and forms a seed. A few months later the seed grows into a fruit or vegetable. Think of an apple tree; it blossoms, is visited by bees, produces apples later in the summer containing pips (the seeds), which if planted could slowly grow into a new apple tree.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09e066ff93fa83d22e0d0dcb9578cf1f5340ac8e\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434468039704/ad1712ce-9ae1-441e-911d-1a887156053e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Ancient Egyptian tomb painting.

While the timescale is wildly exaggerated and fails to take into account man\u2019s ingenuity, it highlights how mankind\u2019s survival has been inextricably linked to bees. Cave drawings dating back 20,000 years depict images of honey hunting. The ancient Egyptians transported their hives along the Nile to pollinate crops and buried their pharaohs with containers full of honey to sweeten the afterlife. The antibacterial and antiseptic properties of honey have made it as important to the apothecary as the chef over the centuries, while beeswax embalmed the dead and created artificial light. In the 15th century, the pilgrim fathers took their honeybees with them to spread their farming practices and colonise the new world. The native Americans called the honeybee the \u201cwhite man\u2019s fly\u201d. The continent had wild bees, but no honeybees, as was the case in Australasia before western settlers arrived.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a3f53cbbabfc2db0702ca25c2b2e4ccf5287029f\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434467192095/0c9744fa-3c05-42e7-9c2f-4a574f1c25c7-460x435.jpeg\" alt=\"The Owl and the Pussy-cat by Edward Lear.

Only four of these species are honeybees, of which the western honeybee (<em>Apis mellifera</em>) is the one we took to the US and then on to Australasia. Honeybees make honey. It\u2019s their winter food, for feeding the 10,000-strong colony in the hive when it\u2019s too cold to fly. Bumblebees don\u2019t make honey we can harvest but they are important pollinators, too. Around 250 species of bees are different types of bumblebees. Their hairier coats can attract more pollen and they can fly at colder temperatures than honeybees. Some species are long-tongued so are better at pollinating plants with long, tubular flowers. And they are capable of \u201cbuzz pollination\u201d \u2013 by shaking the pollen from the anthers of a flower on to the stigma of another \u2013 which is how some crops, notably tomatoes, are pollinated. While most bumblebees are wild, some species are increasingly used commercially to buzz pollinate. Research shows that under the same conditions, bumbles can actually pollinate more flowers per bee than honeybees, though a honeybee colony (50,000 bees in the summer) is much larger than a colony of bumblebees (only 250).</p> <p>The vast majority of the world\u2019s bee species are solitary bees. As their name suggests they live alone. Many are adapted to pollinate one type of plant and their life cycle is synced with the plant so they are able to pollinate it and feed their young at the same time. There\u2019s been little research on solitary bees, but in March, the first ever assessment of all 1,965 bee species across Europe by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) found that almost <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/19/nearly-one-in-ten-of-europes-wild-bee-species-face-extinction-says-study\">one in 10 of Europe\u2019s wild bee species</a> \u2013 most of which are solitary bees \u2013 face extinction as a result of intensive farming, insecticide use and climate change.</p> <p>Most people have heard about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jul/30/buzzfeeds-bees-colony-collapse-disorder\">colony collapse disorder</a>, which wiped out a third of all honeybee colonies in the US when it first struck back in 2007.

When inclement weather confines bees to the hive during the spring and summer they become weak and easy prey for the parasitic <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varroa\">varroa mite</a> to spread viruses that kill off its host.</p> <p>But in many ways, the uncertain future of wild bumblebees and solitary bees is even more alarming than the honeybee death toll, since beekeepers are able to restock their hives each year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d4b2f37cde0ba748dd12f6cfba0ae51d2ef1dc2b\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434467425256/605bcfd1-6746-4fde-80ab-1faf922424b7-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Since 1945 97% of the UK's wildflower meadows, such as this one at Priestcliffe Lees, Derbyshire, have disappeared.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Since 1945, 97% of the UK\u2019s wildflower meadows, such as this one at Priestcliffe Lees, Derbyshire, have disappeared.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The habitat that wild bees depend on to nest and forage is increasingly disappearing due to modern farming practices and urbanisation.

Living things had grown against the odds \u2013 seeds of willowherb and buddleia had lodged themselves in cushions of moss; bindweed crept through holes in the walls. But this was a joyless fight for life. There were no birds here \u2013 without trees, the local colony of house sparrows flew over my garden from one place of safety to another. The only bees were those pollinating the brambles that grew, teasingly close, in next door\u2019s wilderness. I heard foxes at night but they never came near. This was a sad place. And besides, it looked embarrassingly ugly.</p> <p>So I took up the decking, unbuttoned the earth and, gradually, started a garden. I could have borrowed money to get landscapers to do the job in a few days, level it off and leave me with a neat, sanitised skeleton of lawn and empty borders, which I would plant up and tend, as if the garden had never been imprisoned.</p> <p>But I didn\u2019t. I took up the decking myself, every single piece, which I unscrewed, chopped, bashed and swore at, until I was left, two months later, with stones and mud, and a feeling of having bitten off more than I could chew.</p> <p>I persevered. I recycled most of the decking on Gumtree, carrying it through my flat and out through the living room window, and burned or composted the rest. I used the stones to make paths (I didn\u2019t know what else to do with them and couldn\u2019t face taking them through the flat as well). I spent an afternoon in January digging the soil, turning up worms for a hungry robin that followed me and my spade; the promise of things to come. I dug a pond. I erected bee hotels and bird boxes, and turned my living room into a greenhouse, germinating a thousand wildlife-friendly plants. I planted an apple tree, two climbing roses and a clematis, plus native shrubs to attract egg-laying moths. I set free plants that had survived in pots for two years, having been wrenched, as I was, from our previous garden.</p> <p>Creating a garden from scratch isn\u2019t new to me. My last garden was paved, too, and I took up the slabs, brought in topsoil and added wildlife-friendly plants. Over the years I watched wildlife arrive: blue tits and great tits, goldfinches, moth caterpillars. If you build it, they really do come, and if they don\u2019t come, you just build it differently; move the bird box, try a different cultivar.</p> <p>Here, there\u2019s still a long way to go: the climbing roses and clematis have barely covered the ugly fence panels at the back, the slugs have eaten all nine of my sunflowers, the greenhouse looks ridiculous and I might have planted a few too many teasels. But it\u2019s a journey, and every gardener knows a garden is never finished.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"395bbc81b4e8e58f954edab941401a23067bec15\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/395bbc81b4e8e58f954edab941401a23067bec15/0_60_3264_1958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kate Bradbury\u2019s new wildlife pond\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kate Bradbury\u2019s new wildlife pond is already home to whirligig beetles and pond snails.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kate Bradbury</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Happily, my embryonic wildlife garden is now enough for the house sparrows, who sneak in when they think I\u2019m not watching, to bathe in my three-month-old pond.

I tend to my bees with my allotment friend Al. They are the first thing we see when we arrive at the allotment, and we always enjoy a catch up about how they\u2019re doing.</p> <p>Keeping bees is a commitment. It\u2019s heavy work and someone needs to be around all summer long, so it makes sense to do it with friends. Beekeepers are a generous lot, always ready to offer advice and donate equipment and, better still, swarms of bees. These friendships matter as much as any other aspect of beekeeping.</p> <p>Perhaps because of our busy lives, there are more and more community and collective beekeepers, sharing the work as well as the honey.</p> <p>For Harriet Stigner, who is part of the <a href=\"http://www.urbanbeekeeping.co.uk/\">Urban and Community Beekeeping</a> group in London, tending bees offers \u201ca refreshing and completely unique way to connect with people. We get great views on our rooftops; just 15 minutes can be enough to relax and let go of stress.\u201d</p> <p>Community bee-keeping is about so much more than harvesting delicious honey \u2013 although that\u2019s a perk. As Kerry Morrison, part of the <a href=\"http://bee-credible-bees.blogspot.co.uk/\">Bee Friendly</a> collective in Todmorden, says: \u201cWe all want to be part of a community that cares about bees.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Why we keep bees</strong><br></p> <p>The continuing decimation of insects and animals that transfer pollen in Britain has meant that the pin-up of that world, the honeybee, never fails to be out of the papers. There is no single reason why this is happening; in part it could be down to certain pesticides such as neonicotinoids, but the cocktail of other chemicals we put on our crops doesn\u2019t help either. The Varroa mite has also contributed, killing millions of bees worldwide. The decline of wild bee habitats across Europe has a huge effect, too.</p> <p>If you want to become a beekeeper the first thing you should do is encourage all pollinators by growing \u201cforage\u201d plants that have plenty of pollen \u2013 especially during the winter. The <a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/science/conservation-biodiversity/wildlife/encourage-wildlife-to-your-garden/plants-for-pollinators\">Royal Horticultural Society has an extensive list of suitable plants</a> and advice on how to grow them.</p> <p>Remember, bees make honey for themselves, not for us. When they can\u2019t fly because the weather is inclement, they eat their stores (so that\u2019s most of the winter). Taking too much honey out weakens them; honey is a precious gift after a good year, not a reward for all the time you spent tending them.</p> <p><strong>Learn about the hive</strong><br></p> <p>I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s a best method for beekeeping; all the various styles have their strengths and weaknesses. It\u2019s more about which method suits the keeper than the bees. You\u2019ll quickly learn they don\u2019t really give a damn about you anyway.</p> <p>When you open up a hive, what you notice once you\u2019ve got past the panic of seeing thousands of bees is the wax comb, full of hexagonal cells; here the queen lays her eggs. Depending on the stage, you should see eggs, pupae and emerging young bees. The comb is also used to store honey and pollen. When the queen stops laying eggs in preparation for winter, the comb fills with honey stored so the bees have something to eat when they can\u2019t fly in the bad weather.</p> <p>There are many <a href=\"http://www.bbka.org.uk/learn/getting_started/equipment\">different types of hives</a>; the most common are National Hives and their variants, which offer the most amount of honey. There are other hives that allow the bees more freedom to build their own comb, but all of them attempt to recreate a model of how bees behave in the wild. I use a popular one called a top bar hive because it\u2019s a simple set-up \u2013 a horizontal hive with empty bars from which the bees build their comb.</p> <p><strong>Where to keep your bees</strong></p> <p>You can keep bees in gardens, on allotments, in community gardens or sturdy, sheltered rooftops. I know of groups at universities, botanic gardens, fire stations and schools. What all these have in common is that they have access to forage plants \u2013 any plant where they can find pollen. Bees fly up to five miles for food, but life is much easier with flowers available all summer, nearby.</p> <p>Your local chapter of the <a href=\"http://www.bbka.org.uk/\">British Beekeepers Association</a> will have an apiary, or bee yard, with potential spaces (though there might be a waiting list). Membership also gets you third party insurance, which is a must. Your local association may also have a swarm officer, who can help you get free bees. In short, it\u2019s worth the membership.</p> <p>Once you have bees, you should sign up to <a href=\"http://www.nationalbeeunit.com/\">BeeBase</a> (nationalbeeunit.com/), for a free visit from their inspectors, who check for signs of pests and diseases, and offer advice.</p> <h2>Courses</h2> <p>Your local <a href=\"http://www.bbka.org.uk/\">beekeeping association</a> will run courses, night classes and mentor schemes.

Sacks was promiscuously biophilic, and the rapt personal engagement he felt with his patients embraced most of the rest of creation too \u2013 cephalopods, spiders, Oaxacan ferns, and the hunched and scaly survivors of the Jurassic forests he had seen at Kew Gardens as a child. The cycads, especially, enthralled him as relics of the first experiments plants had made in using insects for fertilisation.</p> <p>In the 1990s, Sacks was investigating a rare form of colour blindness in the Pacific islands, caused possibly by eating flour made from cycad seeds. In one passage in his book <em>The Island of the Colourblind</em>, the Romantic botanist displaces the physician with a job to do. He sits on a beach under the cycads, watching fiddler crabs scissoring the kernels from the giant seeds, and notices a single seed, whipped up by the surf and starting to float out to sea. He ponders how its family \u2013 a group of highly variable, fire-resistant, suckering species that developed ways of fixing atmospheric nitrogen 100m years before beans did \u2013 had outlived the dinosaurs, and whether this individual seed, endowed with who-knows-what genetic quirks, might make landfall on a distant island, find a partner and begin the evolution of a new species. Life goes on and forward, but often dips into its back catalogue.</p> <p>In these pragmatic times this is an unorthodox way of regarding a plant. We understand the importance of vegetal life like never before, but only so far as it serves our human needs. Plants have come to be seen as the furniture of the planet: necessary, useful, attractive, but \u201cjust there\u201d, passively vegetating. They may beautify our landscapes and help us breathe, but we have lost the sense of wonder and respect due to them as active agents in their own life stories. Indeed, affording them \u201cintrinsic value\u201d is now taboo in many conservation circles, and they are weighed up purely as commodities. The Wildwood has become an \u201cecosystem service\u201d. Wordsworth\u2019s \u201cgolden host\u201d has been rebranded as \u201cnatural capital\u201d. I wonder about the long-term effects of defining plants as a biological proletariat working for the benefit of our species, without granting them any <em>a priori</em> importance.</p> <p>***</p> <p>We haven\u2019t always been as dismissive of plants as \u2013 to use Sacks\u2019s word \u2013 individual. Throughout history their sheer otherness has made them subjects of meditation about life\u2019s essential constraints and opportunities \u2013 about the boundaries of the self, the nature of ageing, what makes a stonecrop differ from a stone. When I began tracing this tradition of imaginative botany, I found it went at least as far back as the ice age, whose cave painters, in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/nov/03/claude-levi-strauss-obituary\">Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss</a>\u2019s famous phrase, saw organisms as not so much \u201cgood to eat, as good to think\u201d. The number of Palaeolithic plant images is tiny compared with those of animals, but they seem preoccupied with structure and form. Branching patterns appear often, as ribs in a leaf, or as forks \u2013 the basic binary division, the turning of one into two, a universal pattern in nature. There are flower-like forms, too, which may be literal blooms, or imaginings of stars, or phosphenes, those optical flashes seen during trances. I have only seen one carving that has the apparent unambiguousness of a field-guide illustration. On a bone from the Gironde dated to about 15,000 BP (before present \u2013 in carbon dating, before 1950), a twig bearing four bell-like blooms rises up like a miniature maypole in front of a reindeer antler. The flowers are lantern-like, pinched and cut into a \u201cV\u201d at the lip, with their stalks projecting alternately up the stalk. It is a passable impression of a sprig of bilberry, or one of its ericaceous relatives that grew abundantly on the ice age tundra. Foliage and fruit were food for the reindeer, which were, in turn, food for the local hunter-gatherers. So, it\u2019s a clever juxtaposition if it\u2019s deliberate \u2013 except for one complicating feature. When I looked at a closeup photograph of the carving, I spotted something I hadn\u2019t noticed before. Near the point at which each bloom grades into the stalk, there is a small curved line, like a breve or a closed eyelid. When I focused on it, the \u201cflowers\u201d suddenly flipped, like the shapes in an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jun/20/the-impossible-world-of-mc-escher\">Escher</a> illusion. They became birds\u2019 heads and necks, or maybe a notional impression of young, suckling animals. The flower as feeder as well as food. Had the artist made a kind of visual pun, or a metaphorical image about the circularity of the food chain? Palaeolithic artists used metaphors freely, beginning the tradition of glimpsing meaningful resemblances that is a defining feature of human perception. If animals have chiefly provided analogies for our physical behaviour, plants \u2013 rooting, sprouting, branching, flowering, bearing fruit \u2013 have come to be the most natural representations of our patterns of thought.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc2b025a75c001c386bccb83d44f9f7424b31f01\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc2b025a75c001c386bccb83d44f9f7424b31f01/0_0_1772_1063/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A deer head and a bilberry plant carved on a bone, found at the Grotte de Fontarnaud, Gironde, France.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A deer head and a bilberry plant carved on a bone, found at the Grotte de Fontarnaud, Gironde, France.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lysiane Gauthier, Mairie de Bordeaux/Musee d'Aquitaine, Bordeaux</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet metaphor has been a bane as well as a bridge in the difficult business of talking about organisms radically different from us. It is impossible for us to escape our human framings of the world and see what Wordsworth, talking of the primrose, called \u201cthe plant itself\u201d. So an entire cast of green manikins litters the history of our attempts to comprehend plants as active organisms. Ivy is traduced as a vampyric sap-sucker. The trunk, the \u201cbody\u201d of a tree, is seen as analogous to a human body, and therefore killed when lopped from its earthly roots \u2013 a comparison that has bedevilled our entire understanding of and treatment of trees. Yet it is hard to see how we can make sense of our place in the Earth\u2019s web of life without using the allusions and metaphors of our own necessarily anthropomorphic language. Maybe it is not plant metaphor as such that is at fault, as an overliteral use of it.</p> <p>***</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/johnkeats\">John Keats</a> sketched images of plants in his medical student\u2019s notebooks, some around Astley Cooper\u2019s lecture on the human organ that appreciated their fragrance. Keats had been a botanophile since he was a boy. He had foraged in open fields round Edmonton, and gathered nettle leaves to hide in his brothers\u2019 beds. His last letter, written just before he died in 1826, has a final, almost thrilled floral flourish: \u201cO! I can feel the cold earth upon me \u2013 the daisies growing over me \u2013 O for this quiet.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/21/my-hero-oliver-rackham-richard-mabey\">My hero: Oliver Rackham by Richard Mabey</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Five years earlier he found in the real business of efflorescence a perfect model for his idea of \u201cnegative capability\u201d \u2013 a kind of attentive suspension of certainty, the \u201cwise passiveness\u201d advocated by Wordsworth. One fine morning in late February he sat in his rooms in Hampstead and wrote a cheering letter to his friend John Reynolds, then passive from chronic illness not philosophical choice. \u201cIt has been an old Comparison for our urging on \u2013 the Bee Hive \u2013 however it seems to me that we should rather be the flower than the Bee \u2013 for it is a false notion that more is gained by receiving than giving \u2013 no the receiver and the giver are equal in their benefits \u2013 The flower I doubt not receives a fair guerdon from the Bee \u2013 its leaves blush deeper in the next spring \u2013 and who shall say between Man and Woman who is the most delighted? \u2026 let us open our leaves like a flower and be passive and receptive \u2013 budding patiently under the eye of Apollo and taking hints from every noble insect that favors us with a visit.\u201d</p> <p>Keats was giving his friend a get well note, not an ecology lesson, and perhaps echoing the hapless passivity of his own relationship with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jan/25/john-keats-letter-auction\">Fanny Brawne</a>. But I can\u2019t read this passage without suspecting that it is also an allegory based on the real relationships between flowers and insects: that is, vegetal sex by proxy. The detailed mechanisms of insect pollination had been unravelled three decades earlier by two German botanists, yet their revelations were barely noticed in non-scientific circles. They had done their work on the forget-me-not, and the compelling fixity of the flower\u2019s yellow \u201ceye\u201d in attracting pollinators. Both Keats and Coleridge had written poems that highlighted the attractiveness of this \u201cbright eye\u201d. Had Keats, who had read broadly in the sciences for his medical studies, heard the buzz? His talk of \u201cbudding\u201d, of flowers \u201ctaking hints\u201d from insects and the notion of the flower receiving \u201ca fair guerdon\u201d (a reward) in return for its nectar, was as botanically insightful as it was sexually progressive. If so, his little allegory of human creativity was also the richest of metaphors about the reciprocity of plant and insect life.</p> <p>***</p> <p>In the late 1920s, a metaphor more directly sexual than anything insinuated by Keats was coined for the pollination of some orchid species. The family whose best-known European member is the bee orchid was found to encourage what \u2013 with the straightest of faces \u2013 was dubbed \u201cpseudocopulation\u201d. The idea is that male insects mistake the furry, winged flowers for females and attempt to mate with them, collaterally transferring pollen in the process. I have never been convinced by this theory, and its assumption that a visually acute insect might mistake a blob of vegetable tissue for one of its own kind. A friend suggested that perhaps the feel of the flowers\u2019 bodies acted as an additional aphrodisiac to the hormonally charged males. It was an agreeable thought: furry bees clasped to velvet midriffs, \u201crestlessly vibrating\u201d as one early writer put it, and I had the notion of abandoning my usual siding with Keat\u2019s passive flowers and trying to see the transactions from the point of view of the randy and hurrying bee.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5dba9b4c6f3b22f76681d80c81d695ee8973e5e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5dba9b4c6f3b22f76681d80c81d695ee8973e5e4/0_0_1671_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"<em>Native Dinner-Time</em>, illustration from Albert Millican\u2019s <em>Travels and Adventures of an Orchid Hunter</em> (1891).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"735\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><em>Native Dinner-Time</em>, illustration from Albert Millican\u2019s <em>Travels and Adventures of an Orchid Hunter</em> (1891).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brown University Library, Providence, Rhode Island, US</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I procured some fly orchid flowers \u2013 the most convincing insect mimics, which I know well \u2013 and was no more convinced in closeup. The flowers are dark and narrow, the inner petals curled up into stumpy horns, the lip with slight swellings down each edge, which might or might not resemble folded wings. I had seen photographs of the pollinator, a digger wasp, thin-waisted, striped with yellow, and bearing only a passing resemblance to a fly orchid bloom. One of the photos showed three male wasps on top of each other on a single bloom, in the most orderly of floral gangbangs. I cut the two freshest blooms from the stem, and indulged in some pseudo-foreplay. I sniffed them, licked them and rubbed them against my lips. They had no scent whatsoever, but I could feel a texture on the body that reminded me of the pimply surface of a tongue. Then I took them down to insect-world scale under my stereo microscope.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>The family whose best-known European member is the bee orchid was found to encourage what was dubbed 'pseudocopulation'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"3e72f55362a9e5217df1f7ed94533fabade4227a\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/10/15/1444922022544/c6374abd-d5df-4ee2-963f-32115c9be425-279x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Bee orchid.\" width=\"279\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bee orchid.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At 10x the body shape of the flower was still just about legible. I could make out a covering of fine hairs. Whatever surface they were growing from looked papular and spongy. But I was drawn to the dark inverted triangle at the top, which looked as pubic as anything in a Palaeolithic fertility figure. Against my will I was already sexualising the flower, caught up in the orchid family\u2019s famously sensual aura. At 50x the blooms were transformed into spangled landscapes. The individual hairs were clearly visible now, and tipped with iridescence, as if they carried tiny globules of dew. The whole surface of the plant had the glister of organza. And when I shifted to the dark patch, which now filled my whole field of view, I spotted two glowing crescents on either edge. They were made up of individual spots of blue, like tiny LED lights. I wondered if the light from the microscope lamp was producing these effects, but they were still there when I turned it off. A few minutes later, with the lamp back on, I noticed an extraordinary aroma rising from the blooms \u2013 musky, sweaty, meaty. I am sure this was the allomone \u2013 a chemical evolved in the plant to exactly mimic the female wasp\u2019s sexual pheromone, and made perceptible to the human nose by the heat of the lamp.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Discoveries about intricate cross-species communication in plants have opened a new frontier in botany, revealing that the plant kingdom has more than 20 different senses, and examples of what can only be described as vegetal intelligence. Beans locate their poles by echolocation. A Patagonian vine can change the colour and shape of its leaves to match those of the trees it is climbing over. Mimosa, the \u201csensitive plant\u201d, can learn which stimuli are worth curling its leaves against in defence and which are not \u2013 and retain this knowledge for 10 times longer than the memory span of bees. Entire forests are linked by an underground \u201cwood wide web\u201d of fungal \u201croots\u201d that transport and balance nutrient flows and carry signals about disease and drought throughout the network. Traditionalists have derided attempts to describe problem-solving and learning as \u201cintelligent\u201d in organisms that lack a brain. The philosopher <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/dennett\">Daniel Dennett</a>, in a neat parry, has mocked such views as \u201ccerebrocentrism\u201d, and lamented the fact that we find it difficult (and maybe humiliating) to conceive of intelligence as existing in any form other than our own brain-and-neurone variety.</p> <p>But however they are defined, these new findings validate Sacks\u2019s belief in plants as individuals \u2013 active and adaptive agents.

Lo\u0161inj, Croatia</h2> <p><em>Eva Wiseman visits a traditional \u2018wellness island\u2019 reinvented for the 21st-century traveller</em></p> <p>What is a holiday for? Once, I would have confidently said: \u201cFor a break from work\u201d, or if I was being paid by the word, \u201cFor reading bestsellers, in the sun, slightly drunk on local wine and weather, in a bikini and area of patchy phone reception, just bad enough that you have no choice but to fall behind on world news.\u201d</p> <p>But it has become clear that the point of a holiday is a fluid and changeable thing, a thing that tells us much about our seasonal anxieties and spiritual ambitions. Consider for instance the inner workings of the period when a holiday was about \u201ctravel\u201d, about journeying and exploring, broadening our minds through a long plane ride to somewhere hot. Or the focus on \u201ceco-tourism\u201d, where tourists were encouraged to believe they were saving the world by camping.</p> <p>Today, according to <em><a href=\"https://www.lonelyplanet.com/\">Lonely Planet</a></em>, \u201cwellness tourism\u201d is the fastest-growing sector in travel, having seen a 10% rise last year to make it a market worth over $500bn. The <a href=\"https://globalwellnessinstitute.org/\">Global Wellness Institute</a> predicts that by 2020 it will rise to $800bn. Across the globe, retreats and resorts are opening or rebranding, whether it\u2019s yurts in Cornwall or medical clinics in Greece, places to improve oneself, ideally while also getting a tan. And all because a holiday is never just a holiday.</p> <p>It is for this reason that I\u2019m sweating on a six-seater plane with my family, juddering over the Adriatic and pretending to our four-year-old that everything is completely, totally fine. Until now, the island of <a href=\"https://www.visitlosinj.hr/\">Lo\u0161inj</a> in Croatia has been accessible to many only via a five-hour road and ferry trip from Zagreb, so it\u2019s remained a holiday destination for tourists driving from Hungary or Germany. But this year the scattered five-star hotels have started chartering these tiny, terrifying flights to bring a wealthier clientele from Russia and the UK, people attracted by its historic \u201cwellness\u201d credentials.</p> <p>In the late 1800s, after Croatian botanist Ambroz Hara\u010di\u0107 helped reforest this previously rocky port, the Austro-Hungarian government declared Lo\u0161inj a health resort. Today, having dusted off the title \u201cwellness island\u201d, Lo\u0161inj is welcoming a new influx of tourists visiting to enjoy air quality so pure (a combination of salt-spray from the sea, hundreds of thousands of Aleppo pines, and a unique geographical micro-climate) it\u2019s been proven to improve lung health. That and the blue water, the heat, and its relative affordability. Typically, visitors have rented mobile homes or stayed on the campsites, all of which are metres from a stony beach, and most of which have their own massage facilities \u2013 health drills deep here, wellness is not just for the wealthy. But one draw of the newly renovated luxury hotels is the scale of their offerings, vast modern spas, air-conditioned to a gentle chill. We are greeted at the <a href=\"https://www.losinj-hotels.com/en/hotels-and-villas/hotel-bellevue/\">Bellevue</a>, its midcentury furniture suggesting a dozen new ways to relax, with the coldest glasses of water I\u2019ve ever tasted.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"38079037522e29fbef89d455554f7133e423e741\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38079037522e29fbef89d455554f7133e423e741/2152_0_3660_2198/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Veli Lo\u0161inj, fishing village, Lo\u0161inj, Croatia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Veli Lo\u0161inj fishing village.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The spa here stretches across the basement of the white 1960s hotel \u2013 one end is dark-walled and soothing, with colour therapy and steam rooms, the other clinical and spare, offering Botox and cryotherapy.</p> <p>After checking in I walk through the piped music of its hallway, be-robed and dazed \u2013 perhaps it\u2019s the Lo\u0161inj air or perhaps the flight, but I feel almost medicated, floating.</p> <p>The island is only 21 miles long and just under three miles wide \u2013 a coastal path wraps around the bay of \u010cikat, and a guide walks us along it into a forest to pick herbs and plants, which we take back to the spa to blend and distil into a balm. It smells like the island, a rich green scent which follows us as we trot around the cove that evening to a fish restaurant, <a href=\"https://www.losinj-hotels.com/en/dining/konoba-cigale/\">Konoba Cigale</a>, where the proximity to Venice shows in the menu \u2013 they stuff their homemade pasta with seafood caught that morning. Again, that blissful feeling overwhelmed me as our daughter danced to the accordion player and my partner and I looked at each other over our Istrian wine with a sort of stunned disbelief at the glory of it all, at the possibility of a holiday that feels like the photos.</p> <p>Morning came with birdsong. But, a moment here to discuss the breakfast buffet. Too often, I think, hotel guests become jaded by the intense joy delivered to them daily \u2013 this, too, is a side-effect of the holiday experience. A couple of days in and you no longer marvel at the blueness of the sea or the blueness of the sky, or the crisp affordability of the local wine, or, in the case of Lo\u0161inj, the smell, that leafy smell of health and wellness. But if you are four years old and enjoying your first hotel, the breakfast buffet in a grand lobby is by far the most exciting element of any holiday, and remains so every time you emerge from the lift, into this oasis of omelettes and fruit. For the stressed and old, wellness is a simplifying of one\u2019s polluted urban life; for children, it\u2019s cake for breakfast.</p> <p>A freediver ferried us on a speedboat around the bay, stopping to show us secluded caves where we could swim, eventually pulling up to a restaurant on the shore of the tiny car-free island of Ilovik. On the way back, our daughter slept by the engine of the boat in a nest of towels.</p> <p>There was much we didn\u2019t do. We didn\u2019t visit the Museum of Apoxyomenos in the town of Mali Lo\u0161inj, which boasts a single exhibit \u2013 a Greek bronze statue of an athlete dating from the 1st century, found in the sea. We didn\u2019t cycle into the forests, or see a dolphin, or stumble into the naturist colony. We did, however, eat ice cream in the island\u2019s two fishing villages, Veli Lo\u0161inj and Mali Lo\u0161inj, and we did eat at the obscenely romantic Lanterna restaurant, in the shade of an old lighthouse, and we did take a taxi up to the Providenca at sunset, a viewpoint carved into a mountain top. And we did lie motionless on sunloungers with local aloe vera pulp smeared across our sunburned shoulders in the bloated afternoon sun.</p> <p>Though some wellness tourists expect to come home thinner, instead it felt as if we\u2019d returned with a gorgeous weightlessness, the result of a week on this perfumed island with its daily catches and clear water. We braced once more on the tiny plane, our teeth rattling as we insisted, dry-mouthed, that the wings were meant to wobble like that. At home it took some time to rejoin our old commuting routines, our school runs, our doom. Some time to recover from the undiluted joy of a holiday like this, one that left us feeling\u2026 better.<br><em>\u2022 A week\u2019s half-board stay in the four-star <a href=\"https://www.losinj-hotels.com/en/hotels-and-villas/hotel-vespera/\">Family Hotel Vespera</a> costs from \u00a3708pp. A week\u2019s half-board at the five-star Hotel Bellevue costs from \u00a31,514pp, <a href=\"https://www.losinj-hotels.com/\">losinj-hotels.com</a>.

I hadn\u2019t looked at it.</p> <p>Seven days before I was due to meet my fitness fate, my 17-year-old son also looked at the schedule. He promptly telephoned his older brother, who then rang me.</p> <p>\u201cAbout this fitness thing,\u201d he said, \u201cI hear you\u2019re doing something called \u2018insanity\u2019. Are you sure about all this?\u201d</p> <p>My sons expressing concern for their unfit mother. I was touched. And secretly alarmed. From Thursday afternoon until Sunday lunchtime, a new world awaited: of beach runs and burpees, fasted HIIT and tabatas, circuits and squat jumps.</p> <p>I emailed James Davis, who runs 38\u00b0N \u2013 specialising in luxury fitness retreats in Marbella and Ibiza \u2013 with his wife Claire.</p> <p>\u201cAm worried that I am too unfit to benefit from a weekend and that everyone else will be super-fit,\u201d I wrote.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I jumped through the rungs of a ladder on the sand, did star jumps \u2013 and wished I still had a pelvic floor</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t worry,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll do a fitness benchmark. From there, we adapt the training to the individual.\u201d </p> <p>In case he was lying, and because I dreaded the public humiliation more than the heart attack, I did some emergency pre-training: two jogs with the dog, one on my own, and two cycling and running sessions in a gym.</p> <p>The day before departure, I emailed James again: \u201cAm slightly dreading being so hideously unfit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEveryone is at their own level,\u201d he replied, \u201con their own journey, and we\u2019ll have a great time.\u201d</p> <p>And I did. In the words of the late artist Louise Bourgeois: \u201cI have been to hell and back. And let me tell you, it was wonderful.\u201d</p> <p>It really was. I did one form of high-intensity exercise after another, on the beach, on tarmac, in the gym. Just as Sisyphus pushed the rock up the mountain, so James and Claire pushed me on, and on.</p> <p>At 8am, for three mornings running, I did \u201cFasted HIIT: Metcon\u201d. This translates as, skip breakfast, then do high intensity interval training and metabolic conditioning. I jumped through the rungs of a ladder on the sand, like footballers do; did star jumps and wished I had a pelvic floor; I saw, and swung, my first ever kettle bell, thrusting my hips outwards in what looked like a misguided mating call. I picked up two ropes thick enough to moor a tanker and tried, and failed, to wiggle them up and down. By Sunday morning, they were, if not ribbons in my hands, at least airborne.</p> <p>Two boxing sessions with James and I was hooked. I\u2019ve since bought my own gloves and joined a boxing class. During the spin sessions, I slid off the saddle, swore volubly, sweated more, and felt like my legs were being ripped apart. But Claire got me through the pain barrier. She is dynamic, fun and magically motivating.</p> <p>I reported my triumphs, as well as the three-course lunches and sumptuous breakfast banquets overlooking the sea in this fabulous hotel, to the family. \u201cI\u2019m glad (and surprised) you\u2019re still alive,\u201d wrote my older son.</p> <p>I am surprised I\u2019ve since joined a gym, go to this gym, and have signed up to a 38\u00b0N bespoke, 28-day HIIT home workout plan \u2013 short bouts of exercise won\u2019t disrupt my day, so there\u2019s a high chance I\u2019ll do them, armed with my new, can-do mindset.

Undeterred by such scepticism, we pledged to give it our all. The experience on offer seemed idyllic, two nights at a hotel and spa that catered specially to families, even babies. Taking a 90-minute train from Waterloo, we set out to do the unthinkable.</p> <p>\u201cNot much nightlife around,\u201d our cabbie said, just in case we\u2019d come to Brockenhurst in search of an active local grime scene. \u201cBut families love coming here for the views.\u201d On that point, he wasn\u2019t wrong. Around 15 miles southwest of Southampton, New Park Manor Hotel &amp; Spa is set within the decidedly toothsome environs of the New Forest, and we hadn\u2019t been within its gates for 60 seconds before we sighted deer striding through the open park.</p> <p>The manor itself is a grand old house that dates, in some form or another, to the 11th century. Since then it\u2019s been inhabited by lords, landowners and, at one point, Nell Gwyn, mistress of Charles II. It\u2019s only been operating as a hotel since 1970, which rather dashed my fond imaginings of William the Conqueror towelling down in the sauna after a busy day of mutton and jousting.</p> <p>While our room was prepared, we took in one of the nearby forest trails and found the effect so calming it took us a minute to realise our son was similarly transfixed himself. Ordinarily more of a picking-up-spoons-and-throwing-them guy, the perpetual fall of orange-red leaves had placed him in a state of cherubic hypnosis.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For two hours a day, we took in the luxuriously appointed spa while he was lavished with attention in the creche</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>New Park Manor is part of the Luxury Family Hotels group, which specialises in providing plush but unfussy breaks for families, and we entered our room to find a cot, changing mat, baby swimming togs and a rubber duckie. Even better were the bright and colourful creche facilities, to which we delivered the boy for two hours on both days of our stay. Fears he would fret once we parted were, in the end, unfounded. One glance at his charming new handlers was enough to scrub us from his memory, allowing us to take in the luxuriously appointed spa while he was lavished with attention.</p> <p>Leaving the fickle brute to his new pals, we made our way to the spa for the pool, treatment rooms, sauna and sanarium. This last concept was previously unknown to me, and comprised a room that\u2019s basically a sauna, but at a lower temperature and slightly increased humidity. I found it had a gloriously balmy effect on my weary joints and, better still, the information plaque which listed the difference between it and a sauna was slightly obscured from view, so I could inform everyone who came in like some kind of spa connoisseur.</p> <p>My wife and I both had deep-tissue massages, and were rendered pleasantly cross-eyed by Jeanette, who worked our tired muscles until our brains dissolved into warm goo. Upon collecting him from the creche, we took the boy for his first ever swim, an activity to which he took such an immediate and ecstatic liking, it might be the highlight of our entire trip. Better yet, the easy come and go of other families meant we never felt in anyone\u2019s way, and made us think a stay here would be truly ideal for slightly older children, as both the spa and the upstairs nook filled with books and toys, are perfect diversions for curious and mobile kids.</p> <p>We ate in the restaurant both evenings. I particularly enjoyed the chowder and my wife nearly screamed at her menu, the first she\u2019d read in a while where vegetarian was not synonymous with \u201cyou can have mushroom risotto or some leaves\u201d. The restaurant even offered baby monitors in case our little Michael Phelps rose from his slumber. He did, on both evenings, but the process of jaunting upstairs to settle him was so pain-free, it made us reflect on the true success of what was a wonderful weekend. Holidaying with a baby isn\u2019t about having the work done for you; it\u2019s about providing the tools and environment to make that work more worth it than ever.<br>\u2022 <em>The </em><em>Baby\u2019s First Stay Away package costs from \u00a3469 for two nights, with dinner, including two 30-minute spa treatments, a two-hour creche session each day and welcome hamper</em><em> <a href=\"https://www.newparkmanorhotel.co.uk/\">(newparkmanorhotel.co.uk</a>)</em></p> <h2>13.

It\u2019s hot, really hot, with a gloopy, oily consistency making it move strangely \u2013 less like water than a thick milkshake. Wading in, I find it is also ridiculously buoyant. Infused with magnesium salts, it\u2019s three times denser than the Dead Sea. Why struggle to keep upright? I drop back and float. Blimey, it\u2019s relaxing. I feel weightless, and spend the prescribed 10 minutes watching clouds drift overhead.</p> <p>I\u2019m at the impressive Aquaforte spa, within Sardinia\u2019s Forte Village. When the resort built its six thalassotherapy pools 25 years ago, it was something of a pioneer. The pools become successively cooler and less murky as guests progress through each 90-minute circuit.</p> <p>The second pool has a lower concentration of sea oil, plus anti-inflammatory aloe vera and mint. The third, is a sodium-rich pool with sea salt. The fourth is pure sea water with vigorous hydrojets. Pools five and six are the coldest \u2013 a refreshing 20C. They\u2019re all in an idyllic setting surrounded by trees.</p> <p>\u201cThe term thalassotherapy comes from the Greek and means sea treatment,\u201d says Dr Angelo Cerina, who created the spa in the 1990s. \u201cIt brings together a number of factors: climate, sun, wind, iodine-laden air, sand, muds and seaweed.\u201d</p> <p>Each pool is designed for a different effect: buoyancy in the first pool is to help post-traumatic recovery, and the salt level promotes powerful draining effects. The full circuit is recommended for skin disorders, such as psoriasis, and joint problems \u2013 and for people like me for, simply, wonderful relaxation.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When I\u2019m wrapped in a fluffy robe, I sip herbal tea and read the tempting menu of body treatments</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>(Note: it\u2019s less relaxing if you shave your legs immediately before coming to the spa, because the salty water will sting like a thousand bees \u2013 but, happily, the sharp pain soon passes.)</p> <p>Forte Village is a giant beach resort 45 minutes from Cagliari airport, but arranged to feel small \u2013 intimate and exclusive. It has variety of room options in its eight hotels dotted around the lush gardens, from the bijou to palatial villas. During high season there are 21 restaurants (Sardinian, Mexican, Brazilian, pizza, gourmet\u2026)</p> <p>Also, in high season, however, Forte Village is expensive, the shops packed with slick designer labels and restaurants run by celebrity chefs such as Gordon Ramsay. We went in October when it was blissfully \u2013 sometimes eerily \u2013 quiet. Perfect for a spa break, and much easier on the wallet, though quite a few of the hotels, restaurants and facilities were closed.</p> <p>I was knackered and needed time-out, but others come for the high-tech medical centre, offering expert sports medicine, nutrition advice and osteopathy.</p> <p>Indeed, Forte Village is quite a magnet for top-ranking tennis players. While I was there, many up-and-coming pros worked out in the gym and relaxed their muscles in the pools after matches. Professor Pier Francesco Parra, medical specialist to the Italian Davis Cup national team who has treated the likes of Novak Djokovic and Venus Williams, is on hand during key periods to sort out the bad backs of the tennis players \u2013 and normal guests alike.</p> <p>The 90-minute pool circuit is as active as I get during our short stay. When I\u2019ve dried off and wrapped myself in a fluffy bathrobe, I relax in the spa\u2019s beautiful reception, sipping herbal tea, and reading from the tempting menu of hands-on body treatments. Salt exfoliation, followed by Ayurvedic massage using warm Sardinian honey? Or a water-based massage while floating in pool three?</p> <p>I went for the first: wonderful.

It was awash with bright yellow dandelions, and each one was peppered with several <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollen_beetle\">pollen beetles</a>, perhaps enjoying their first meal of the year. A week later the dandelions were buzzing with bees, but a few days after that, this little patch of wildflowers had been razed \u2013 what happened to the pollen beetles and the bees?</p> <p>As I write, thousands of hectares of such wildflower habitat are being destroyed under the blades of our lawn mowers, and the bees, pollen beetles, butterflies and moths are going hungry. As a weed, it\u2019s one of the most unpopular of the bunch: dandelion tap roots are notoriously hard to dig out, the plants have an almost unrivalled knack of propagating themselves, including in walls and cracks in paving where nothing else would live, and \u2013 to add insult to injury \u2013 they are often the first flower we see in spring and the last in autumn. The dandelion is bold and brash and unrelenting. But that is why it is brilliant. It\u2019s virtually everywhere and nearly always in flower; it\u2019s the pollinator\u2019s best friend.</p> <p>Dandelion (<em>Taraxacum officinale)</em>, was named after the French <em>dent de lion</em>, meaning lion\u2019s tooth, which refers to its toothed leaves. Other names for dandelion include wet-the-bed and pissy-beds, which refer to its effectiveness as a diuretic.</p> <p>The young leaves are edible and loaded with vitamins and antioxidants, the roots can be ground into a (quite tasty) coffee substitute, and the flowers can be made into wine (just leave some for the wildlife). Historically, its sap was said to cure warts, while a tea made using its leaves was supposed to help calm stomach aches. Herbalists apparently still use dandelions to treat skin conditions, asthma, low blood pressure, poor circulation, ulcers, constipation, colds and hot flushes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"37780d31b3e62967dc6f81aba1e8b62dc810bdf2\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/11/1431351021215/26a57d89-a2ee-4ae5-996b-56a2df2219a5-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Dandelions against a blue sky\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Take a couple of weeks off from mowing the lawn and you\u2019ll find a whole host of garden wildlife enjoying the flowers and seedheads.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Ruegner/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But back to the wildlife: while in flower for most of the year, the dandelion\u2019s peak flowering time is from late March to May, when many bees and other pollinators emerge from hibernation. Each flower in fact consists of up to 100 florets, each one packed with nectar and pollen. This early, easily available source of food is a lifesaver for pollinators in spring.</p> <p>Bumblebees, solitary bees and honeybees all visit dandelions for food, along with hoverflies, beetles, and butterflies such as the peacock and holly blue. Goldfinches and house sparrows eat the seed. Yet most of us gardeners miss out on the spectacle of watching wildlife feast on our dandelions, because we wage such a war against them as weeds.</p> <p>So perhaps we could take a couple of weeks off from mowing the lawn this month, or at least raise the cutting height of the mower? We\u2019ll be rewarded with the sight of bees, butterflies, hoverflies and beetles feasting on the flowers, and goldfinches and house sparrows tucking into the seed. We\u2019ll also have time for more interesting activities than mowing. </p>", "wordcount": "502"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}, {"id": "environment/2016/aug/18/honeysuckle-woods-backstone-bank-weardale-country-diary", "type": "article", "sectionId": "environment", "sectionName": "Environment", "webPublicationDate": "2016-08-18T04:30:23Z", "webTitle": "Honeysuckle climbs for sunlight in the wood's deep shadow", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/18/honeysuckle-woods-backstone-bank-weardale-country-diary", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/aug/18/honeysuckle-woods-backstone-bank-weardale-country-diary", "fields": {"byline": "Phil Gates", "body": "<p>It had been more than four months since we last walked through this woodland.

Seedlings face a long climb, coiling around any support within reach during their ascent to the sunlit canopy. That may take a decade, and gnarled old specimens develop thick stems, like tropical <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/plant/liana\">lianas</a>, trailing long strips of loose, papery bark that are torn off by woodland birds as nesting material.</p> <p>Fortune had favoured these young plants: there was no need to climb far because a tree had fallen, creating a glade where early morning sunshine flooded in. A hint of their nocturnal floral fragrance still hung in the air and, like glowing beacons, the flowers lured <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/aug/03/sillyseason.science\">hoverflies</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/04/flight-of-the-bumblebee-survey-finds-individual-personalities\">bumblebees</a> from the shadows.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"00604e1b4a3aacca68d2ea42b4c87722fd2b5f4c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/00604e1b4a3aacca68d2ea42b4c87722fd2b5f4c/0_0_2339_1439/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Honeysuckle leaf with white tunnel markings\" width=\"1000\" height=\"615\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tunnels made by leaf-mining larvae on honeysuckle in Backstone Bank wood, Weardale.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Gates</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In August there are few sources of pollen here, aside from fading flowers of <a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/Advice/Profile?PID=781\">enchanter\u2019s nightshade</a>.

Secreted deep in the tubular corollas, it is accessible only to the long, uncoiling proboscis of a crepuscular moth. Honeysuckle flowering needs bright sunshine but its blooms only fulfil their destiny after sunset.</p> <p>Some small flies resting on the flowers were almost certainly <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatomyia_aprilina\">Chromatomyia aprilina</a></em>, whose leaf-mining larvae feed inside honeysuckle leaves.

In reality these two features are largely incompatible. Made up mainly of annual crops, most veg beds require a constant cycle of sowing, planting, mulching and digging over every season. Many crops also demand early sowings indoors, followed by slow acclimatisation and careful planting out. This is before we even get on to the laborious process of pruning, training and protection. All things considered, the dream of a truly low-maintenance veg plot can seem distant.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Tomatillos can produce kilos of fruit per plant, popping back year after year</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It has always surprised me, therefore, that few books ever point out the range of crops that are enthusiastic self-seeders. Essentially these act like perennials by sowing themselves for you each year, slashing the work needed to grow them to virtually zero. Here are my top picks for tasty, super-easy crops that if sown just once could provide you with harvests for years to come.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/audio/2016/jan/23/perennial-vegetables\">Perennial Vegetables: Sow, Grow, Repeat Winter</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Wild rocket and land cress</h2> <p>It might cost a fortune in little bags from the supermarket, but \u201csuperfood\u201d wild rocket also lives a double life as a common garden weed, enthusiastically self-seeding every year in many a salad bed. Likewise, the peppery leaves of land cress might look and taste virtually identical to watercress, but are far less effort to grow. There is even a pretty variegated form with marbled yellow patterns that look striking in any salad.</p> <h2>New Zealand spinach</h2> <p>This attractive plant in the spinach family, also known as <em>Tetragonia tetragonoidies</em>, offers up more tasty, glossy green leaves than my family can eat, right up until the first hard frosts. Much quicker-growing than its more familiar relative, it even forms an attractive ground cover in sunny beds and borders. Tasting very similar to regular spinach, it has the added benefit of not cooking down to nothing in the blink of an eye and even retains its bright green hue for far longer once heated.</p> <h2>Tomatillos</h2> <p>With the explosion of authentic Mexican restaurants in the UK, the fruit of this salsa staple have just started edging into the fancier supermarkets, sold at up to \u00a32 each. Fortunately for greedy gardeners, these easy-to-grow tomato relatives can produce kilos of fruit per plant, popping back year after year from self-sown seed. Give them a sunny spot, allowing them to sprawl in every direction, and you will be rewarded with tart green fruit and flowers that are irresistible to bees all summer long.</p> <p><em>Email James at <a href=\"mailto:james.wong@observer.co.uk\">james.wong@observer.co.uk</a> or follow him on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Botanygeek?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@Botanygeek</a></em></p>", "wordcount": "424"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}, {"id": "lifeandstyle/2015/apr/11/alys-fowler-hairy-footed-flower-bee", "type": "article", "sectionId": "lifeandstyle", "sectionName": "Life and style", "webPublicationDate": "2015-04-11T05:00:08Z", "webTitle": "Alys Fowler: comfrey, pulmonaria and hairy-footed flower bees", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/apr/11/alys-fowler-hairy-footed-flower-bee", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2015/apr/11/alys-fowler-hairy-footed-flower-bee", "fields": {"byline": "Alys Fowler", "body": "<p>I have a huge fondness for the <a href=\"http://urbanpollinators.blogspot.co.uk/2013/04/the-hairy-footed-flower-bee-anthophora.html\" title=\"\">hairy-footed flower bee</a>. They hover around you as if they are checking you out: I&#xa0;like a moment where nature turns the table and stares back at you. And it\u2019s hard not to love a bee that likes to stick out its tongue. When they are not doing this, they fly fast; they dart about, then hover, then go back to darting. The male bee emerges first in March; he is bright ginger with hairy feet and a blondish moustache. The females are almost entirely black. You often find them checking out pretty flowers, tongue out in preparation. They are very partial to the lungwort family.</p> <p>The bees are on the wing from spring to early summer, by which point they build a single nest, laying their eggs in excavations, mud banks and soft mortar in walls.

I had almost given up on it.</p> <p>\u2018Freckles\u2019 is a cultivar of <em>Clematis cirrhosa</em>. Native to the Mediterranean and parts of North Africa, it requires a bit more shelter than spring- and summer-flowering varieties. But it\u2019s worth the extra effort \u2013 it\u2019s the first clematis of the year to flower, bearing scented, open bells in cream with brick-red \u2018freckles\u2019 within.</p> <p>The pendent flowers are best viewed from below, so it works best when trained up an arch or against a wall. I planted mine next to my garden gate where I could enjoy its blooms whenever I passed through.

They were worth the wait.</p> <p>Flowering from November through to February, \u2018Freckles\u2019 and other <em>C. cirrhosa</em> cultivars bloom when there\u2019s little else around. And not only do the flowers look good, but their nectar and pollen fills the hungry gap for winter bees.</p> <p>Like flowers, most bees are tucked up in winter: honeybees shelter in their hives and bumble and solitary bees hibernate until temperatures increase in spring. But increasingly, in southern areas and especially in towns and cities, buff-tailed bumblebee queens establish winter colonies. They take advantage of the warmer winters, reduced competition for food and increase of winter flowers in gardens and parks, and their workers brave snow and ice to gather pollen and nectar for the grubs back in the nest.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f18fe85fdf893fc4e1b6da95907506f1b9420074\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/27/1422351851733/7a5b659c-f9d0-4e1d-8478-802c41b3f17f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Winter honeysuckle (Lonicera x purpusii). \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Winter honeysuckle (<em>Lonicera</em> x <em>purpusii</em>) also offers food for wandering bees.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steffen Hauser/botanikfoto/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Clematis</em> \u2018Freckles\u2019 therefore joins the ranks of other winter-flowering plants such as mahonia, winter honeysuckle (<em>Lonicera</em> x <em>purpusii </em>) and <em>Fatsia japonica</em> as being essential for winter-active bees, and not just those brave enough to establish winter colonies.

There are almost 251,000 acres of rural road verges across the country that are home to 703 species of wild plants \u2013 87 of which are facing extinction.</p> <p>Britain has lost 97% of its wildflower meadows since the 1930s as land has been turned over to grow food crops. Rural roadside verges and small, family-owned farms remain the only places left for species such as the <a href=\"http://www.first-nature.com/flowers/melampyrum-cristatum.php\" title=\"\">crested cow-wheat</a>, <a href=\"http://www.plantlife.org.uk/wild_plants/plant_species/spiked_rampion\" title=\"\">spiked rampion</a> and <a href=\"http://www.plantlife.org.uk/wild_plants/plant_species/man_orchid\" title=\"\">man orchid </a>to thrive. These roadside verges represent the last stronghold of British wildflowers yet they are being mown down by local councils because of budgetary pressures and a lack of guidance, conservationists have warned.</p> <p>The Local Government Association says councils must keep verges short to ensure motorists have a good line of sight and allow pedestrians to walk safely alongside busy roads. Other reasons are to prevent the spread of weeds and invasive species into private gardens and pressure from local communities to maintain a certain aesthetic appearance.</p> <p>But the charity <a href=\"http://www.plantlife.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Plantlife</a> says local councils are \u201ccutting too much and too early\u201d, depriving flowers of the chance to seed and reproduce. It wants the first cutting, which is currently taking place in May or June, to be delayed until late July, and for councils to manage verges for wildlife in a way that would encourage wildflowers.</p> <p>\u201cIt all boils down to a change of management,\u201d says Dr Trevor Dines, botanical specialist at Plantlife. \u201cYes, the verges need management and you have to have an annual cut, but what we\u2019re finding is species being mown down in their prime. There is a battle on either side of the hedge \u2013 we\u2019ve already lost the battle on the farmers\u2019 side, now we are starting to lose it on the road side too. There is a sense of summer being removed from our roadsides.\u201d</p> <p>Wildflowers are important as just one species can support a whole ecosystem from fungi and invertebrates, through insect-eating birds and small mammals, to birds of prey. They are key habitats for pollinators such as bees and butterflies, whose numbers have seen huge declines in recent years.</p> <p>\u201cA huge number of species use these plants. The common<a href=\"http://www.plantlife.org.uk/wild_plants/plant_species/common_birds-foot_trefoil\" title=\"\"> birds-foot trefoil</a>, for example, which has a lovely pea-like flower, can provide food for more than 160 different types of invertebrates,\u201d says Dines. \u201cPlants are the energy house of all other species \u2013 if we get that mixture of plants back we get diversity with everything else.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2dce043b3af399bc41eae37ce411b2cf29f37ca0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2dce043b3af399bc41eae37ce411b2cf29f37ca0/0_131_5464_3278/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018We need to try to encourage people to think about verges as a network of nature reserves,\u2019 says Dr Trevor Dines.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We need to try to encourage people to think about verges as a network of nature reserves,\u2019 says Dr Trevor Dines.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some species even act as biological lawnmowers. <a href=\"http://www.plantlife.org.uk/wild_plants/plant_species/yellow_rattle\" title=\"\">Yellow rattle</a> is an annual plant that taps into the roots of grasses and reduces their growing rate by up to 60%, giving other wildflowers the space to grow. Dorset council is trialling its use on verges to reduce cutting and save money.</p> <p>Rural verges around junctions, sightlines and road signs are cut early in summer for road safety reasons. Anything that could compromise drivers is necessary, Dines says, but he believes some councils are using this as an excuse to mow all of their verges too early in the year.</p> <p>Many councils are also harming wildflower verges by cutting a one-metre strip either side of the road and leaving the back section untouched. Cutting one single \u201cpass\u201d of 1m width is quick and cheap, and meets road safety obligations, but \u201cthis means the back of the verge turns to scrub quite quickly and we see a loss of diversity,\u201d says Dines. To benefit wildflowers, councils need to return and cut the whole width, doubling the time and the cost.</p> <p>That way, \u201cthe whole verge would be cut properly, and you would get some species coming back and flowering a bit later,\u201d said Dines. \u201cThere is a benefit there but in terms of order of preference we would prefer to leave the whole verge to grow as natural meadow would.\u201d</p> <p>Another challenge is appeasing the so-called neat and tidy brigade, Dines says, who are likely to complain if the verges are left to grow longer for the benefit of wildflowers. \u201cThey are a really powerful lobby and there is a strong feeling among councils that they need to be seen to be doing their job,\u201d says Dines. \u201cDelays to verge-cutting is one of the first things people will complain about.\u201d</p> <p>Plantlife is celebrating nine councils who are leading the way in better managing their road verges for wildlife: Gateshead, Wakefield, Shropshire, Brighton and Hove, Windsor and Maidenhead, Surrey, Poole, Dorset and Cambridgeshire.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.dorsetforyou.gov.uk/conservation-verge-trials\" title=\"\">Dorset council</a>, with open heathland, chalkland and dry, sandy verges supporting rarities such as <a href=\"http://www.luontoportti.com/suomi/en/kukkakasvit/wood-vetch\" title=\"\">wood vetch</a> and <a href=\"http://www.plantlife.org.uk/wild_plants/plant_species/fly_orchid\" title=\"\">fly orchid</a>, is leading the charge. As well as its trial with yellow rattle, it is investigating different methods of management designed to lower soil fertility, leading to reduced grass growth and less frequent cutting.</p> <p>\u201cWe are lucky to have some stunningly beautiful verges with a wide range of habitats that support an even wider range of wildlife,\u201d says Graham Stanley, senior ranger of Dorset countryside. \u201cRare species of orchid, for example, can thrive here whereas on the other side of the hedge, in an arable or heavily grazed field, they simply cannot.</p> <p>\u201cWildlife conservation can coexist with the need for road safety. Changing people\u2019s views on what is a safe and \u2018pretty\u2019 verge is one of our most important roles.\u201d</p> <p>Dines says changing perceptions is key. \u201cWe need to try to encourage people to think about verges as a network of nature reserves.

Bumblebee hives stopped growing and produced less queens where the chemical was present. However the study did not find evidence that more robust honeybees, which are used to pollinate many crops, were affected.</p> <p>Dr Maj Rundl\u00f6f, the lead author of the study, said the impacts on wild bees were \u201cdramatic\u201d. \u201cI think it\u2019s really important evidence when discussing how neonicotinoids used in real agricultural landscapes influence bees,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Dave Goulson, a bee expert at Sussex University, not involved in the research, hailed the findings as hugely significant. </p> <p>\u201cAt this point in time it is no longer credible to argue that agricultural use of neonicotinoids does not harm wild bees.\u201d He said the paper was \u201ca major step forwards in clarifying the neonicotinoid debate ... This was the first fully field-realistic, well-replicated trial so far, an impressive piece of work.\u201d</p> <p>Previous field experiments on neonicotinoids have been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/26/uk-drew-wrong-conclusion-from-its-neonicotinoids-study-scientist-says\">shown to be inadequate</a>. The current EU moratorium on the use of a group of neonicotinoids on certain crops has been criticised, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/apr/28/europe-insecticides-ban-save-bees\">particularly by the UK government</a>, on the basis that field evidence of neonicotinoids harming bee populations has been difficult to obtain.</p> <p>Nick von Westenholz, chief executive of the <a href=\"http://www.cropprotection.org.uk/\">Crop Protection Association</a> that represents neonicotinoid producers Bayer and Syngenta, said: \u201cThe latest studies in Nature must be seen in the context of an ongoing campaign to discredit neonicotinoid pesticides, regardless of what the real evidence shows.\u201d<br></p> <p>He said Rundl\u00f6f\u2019s results were questionable as the levels of the pesticide found in pollen on the bees was higher than <a href=\"https://peerj.com/articles/652.pdf\">in previous studies</a>, suggesting that Rundl\u00f6f had treated the crops herself rather than using industry-standard seeds. Rundl\u00f6f said the rapeseed in the study were treated following the manufacturers\u2019 recommendations. </p> <p>\u201cBayer CropScience is pleased the Swedish study demonstrates yet again there is no effect of neonicotinoids on honeybee colonies in realistic field conditions, consistent with previous published field studies,\u201d said a spokesman for the agrochemical giant. But it criticised the methodology of Rundl\u00f6f\u2019s experiment and said the study offered no proof of increased bee deaths.</p> <p>Rundl\u00f6f said the field trial was not sensitive enough to detect anything less than a 20% drop in colony strength. Honeybee colonies are larger and contain far more worker bees than wild bees, meaning it would take longer for neonicotinoids to impact the hives.</p> <p>Dr Christopher Connolly, from the Medical Research Institute at Dundee University, said: \u201cMuch longer periods would be required to detect deficits in honeybee colonies.\u201d He said the evidence of the effect on bumblebees was a \u201cmajor advance\u201d.</p> <p>In the other study published on Wednesday, a team at Newcastle University in England discovered bees cannot detect the presence of neonicotinoids at low levels. In fact for two varieties of pesticide they tended to prefer toxin-laced sucrose. </p> <p>Scientists suggested the chemicals, which have a similar molecular structure to nicotine, may be affecting the reward centres in bee\u2019s brain in the same way humans are affected by cigarettes.</p> <p>Professor Geraldine Wright, who led the study, said that the addictive effect was not something they had tested for and was only a hypothesis.</p> <p>\u201cLike nicotine they are essentially amplifying the rewarding properties of the sucrose solution that they are located in and the bees think its more rewarding so they go back to that food tube to drink more of it,\u201d she said. <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0032432\">Previous studies</a> have showed rat\u2019s brain responding to neonicotinoid in this way.</p> <p>Wright said she was confident the evidence that bees cannot taste neonicotinoids would be replicated in the field. This contradicts previous suggestions, again <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/221052/pb13937-neonicotinoid-bees-20130326.pdf\">from the UK government</a> among others, that bees can choose to collect pollen from non-treated plants.</p> <p>Connolly said: \u201cIt will be interesting to see if insects become addicted to neonicotinoids over time as humans become addicted to nicotine. Given that the neonicotinoids are commonly found in our farmed environment at these levels, this may have already occurred.\u201d</p> <p>The pesticide industry said even if there was a preference, there was no effect on the bees\u2019 health. \u201cWhat\u2019s important is not whether bees show a slight preference for these crops, but that there is no effect on their health when field-realistic amounts of these pesticides are used,\u201d said von Westenholz. </p> <p>Goulson said that even before the new studies were published on Wednesday, \u201cthere was already a large body of evidence which very strongly suggested that exposure of bees to neonicotinoids at field-realistic doses did them substantial harm.\u201d</p>", "wordcount": "888"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "environment/2016/jul/04/growth-in-artificial-lawns-poses-threat-to-british-wildlife-conservationists-warn", "type": "article", "sectionId": "environment", "sectionName": "Environment", "webPublicationDate": "2016-07-04T06:00:02Z", "webTitle": "Growth in artificial lawns poses threat to British wildlife, conservationists warn", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/04/growth-in-artificial-lawns-poses-threat-to-british-wildlife-conservationists-warn", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/jul/04/growth-in-artificial-lawns-poses-threat-to-british-wildlife-conservationists-warn", "fields": {"byline": "Sandra Laville", "body": "<p>Environmentalists have warned that a growing trend to lay artificial lawns instead of real grass threatens the loss of wildlife and habitat across Britain.</p> <p>From local authorities who purchase in bulk for use in street scaping, to primary schools for children\u2019s play areas and in the gardens of ordinary suburban family homes, the sight of pristine, green artificial grass is becoming a familiar sight.

So yes we are concerned at its proliferation.\u201d</p> <p>But the demand for the flawless vibrant green carpet, which needs little or no maintenance and does not need cutting, is growing. Some landscape gardeners are dropping their traditional gardening work in favour of spending 100% of their time excavating soil, laying hardcore and installing fake lawns.</p> <p>Paul Wackett, a landscape gardener from Cobham in Surrey, said: \u201cIt has gone absolutely crazy this year. Ninety nine percent of it is domestic homes \u2013 from small houses up to large houses with big gardens who use it as a feature around their hot tubs.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone is living in a very busy world now, no one has time to do anything except work. They work hard and they play hard so they are having this laid if they have children or dogs and they want to enjoy the garden but don\u2019t have want to maintain it. There is no lawn mowing, no watering.\u201d</p> <p>Companies from small start-ups to longstanding market leaders that began life providing artificial turf for football and hockey pitches are reporting similar demand.</p> <p>Eamon Sheridan, managing director of Artificial Grass London, said there had been an increase in demand across the board. \u201cWe have seen a 63% increase in sales in our case, but we are part of a group of companies, one of which, Artificial Grass Direct, has been established a lot longer, and so far they have seen a 220% increase in sales this year on last year.\u201d</p> <p><a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jun/08/london-gardens-parks-paved\">Research in 2011</a> revealed that 3,000 hectares (12 sq miles) of garden vegetation had been lost over eight years in the UK \u2013 which amounts to more than two Hyde Parks a year. Much, if not all, of this loss was down to decking, concreting over gardens, and the use of artificial grass, Frith said.</p> <p>Paul de Zylva, senior nature campaigner for Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cI think the negative impacts of artificial grass are substantial. For the sake of convenience and not wanting the children to get muddy, what is it we are losing here? </p> <p>\u201cYou will find bees burrowing into lawns which are a mix of grass seeds, other insects will be in there too, and worms \u2013 which are incredibly important in terms of the ability of the soil to absorb nutrients and keep soil structured, so that when you have heavy rain or drought you have a soil system which can cope. By using artificial grass, you lose all this. You are creating a \u2018Don\u2019t come here sign,\u2019 for wildlife.\u201d</p> <p>Even those who have benefited from the boom in fake grass are finding that high demand does not always mean an easy life.</p> <p> Robert Redcliffe, managing director of Nam grass, which has been in the UK for six years, said the demand was now so great that his high-quality European-made product was increasingly being undercut by cheaper imports from the far east.</p> <p>\u201cIt is becoming, as everything does, a very, very competitive market; we can use all our unique selling points but at the end of the day it\u2019s the price that talks,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery day there are boatloads of low-quality, cheaper products being shipped over from China.

One of the world\u2019s most charismatic mammals can also be one of the most dangerous. And humans are finding it harder and harder to keep out of its way.</p> <p>I grew up in a small town called Gudalur in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nilgiri_mountains\">Nilgiri Hills</a>, among elephants and stories about them. Elephants always fascinated me, and I\u2019m in the middle of a PhD, trying to better understand how people and elephants share space. It\u2019s an interest that almost grew out of necessity. The Gudalur region is about 500 square kilometres, or about one third the size of London, covered mostly by tea and coffee plantations and patches of forests. It\u2019s home to a quarter of a million people, about 150 elephants and a host of other wild animals ranging from bears and tigers to flycatchers and martens. Every year, about a dozen people get killed in accidental encounters with elephants.</p> <p>***</p> <p>There are now more than 7 billion humans on Earth, with <a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/publications/world-population-prospects-2015-revision.html\">almost 10 billion expected by 2050</a>. Most of us want to save wildlife, but we have less and less space to do so, and our growth and ever-increasing consumption inevitably put us into contact with wild animals. The concept of \u201chuman-wildlife conflict\u201d is becoming central to conservation work.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"da4a986c8f4039162d5c30fd429dc1e53481b590\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da4a986c8f4039162d5c30fd429dc1e53481b590/0_0_5502_3462/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Wildlife corridor \u2013 please drive slow\u2019: a warning for drivers in Kaziranga national park, Assam.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"629\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Wildlife corridor \u2013 please drive slow\u2019: a warning for drivers in Kaziranga national park, Assam.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Altaf Qadri/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is of course particularly pronounced for the world\u2019s largest land mammal. Elephants are far-ranging animals, and their requirements for food and water are tremendous \u2013 up to 300kg of vegetable matter and 200 litres of water every day. They find human agriculture an attractive food source, competing with people in areas where they overlap. They do not directly prey on livestock (or people) like the big cats, but the overall impact they have on humans is much greater \u2013 they cause extensive damage to crops and property, they compete with livestock for food and water, and they sometimes kill people in accidental encounters. There are also <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sushrut_Jadhav/publication/248702198_The_hidden_dimensions_of_human-wildlife_conflict_Health_impacts_opportunity_and_transaction_costs/links/0c96051e069e963173000000.pdf\">\u201chidden dimensions of conflict\u201d</a>, with people unable to lead normal lives because of the elephants around them. Indigenous children in the Gudalur region, for instance, often can\u2019t go to school because there are elephants blocking the path. The people who suffer most from contact with elephants are invariably those who already lead strained and tenuous lives.</p> <p>Elephants, meanwhile, are being forced out of their natural surroundings by large agribusinesses converting forests to farmland. In Asia particularly, \u201clinear infrastructure\u201d such as roads and highways cuts up their habitat and makes long-range movement more and more challenging. Elephants are run down by trains and electrocuted by illegal fences and low-hanging wires. On top of these accidental hardships, they are deliberately slaughtered for their tusks, or in retaliation for damage to crops and property. </p> <p>The biggest cause of human-elephant conflict (HEC), however, is that elephants simply cannot live within the small fenced-off areas that we call the \u201cprotected area network\u201d. Globally, only around 20% of their range is formally protected, and their future hinges on their ability to continue to share space with people \u2013 to be tolerated by individuals and communities. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"37d9c6ef442430b960dd9903ee7389c4cac360ea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/37d9c6ef442430b960dd9903ee7389c4cac360ea/0_0_4156_2831/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A vet shoots an elephant with a tranquiliser dart outside Amboseli national park in Kenya.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"681\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A vet shoots an elephant with a tranquiliser dart outside Amboseli national park in Kenya, where the International Fund for Animal Welfare is studying migration routes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carl de Souza/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Elephants range through 50 countries in Asia and Africa. Traditionally two species have been recognised \u2013 the Asian (<em><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/7140/0\">Elephas maximus</a></em>) and African (<em><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/12392/0%5D\">Loxodonta africana</a></em>), although the African elephant is now subdivided into the savanna and forest elephant (<em>Loxodonta africana cyclotis</em>). While both species have similar requirements for food and water, the contexts differ vastly, particularly with respect to interactions with humans. Simply put, Asian elephants share their territory with a lot more people. Southern Africa, for example, with a relatively well managed elephant population, has about 25 humans per square kilometre. In south Asia the figure is closer to 350 people per square kilometre. HEC is therefore clearly a much bigger problem in Asia than Africa. That said, human population growth rates are higher in Africa, and there is a much more rapid agricultural expansion. Poaching for ivory is a big conservation challenge now, but HEC could worsen in the years to come.</p> <p>HEC also manifests itself in very different ways across the two continents. Crop damage and accidental human death are the biggest concerns in Asia, while competition among elephants and livestock over resources (grazing areas and key water sources) is often a source of conflict in Africa. In terms of sheer numbers and range, the African species is almost an order of magnitude greater than the Asian \u2013 over 500,000 elephants spread across 2 million square kilometres versus about 50,000 spread across half a million square kilometres.</p> <p>India, almost paradoxically, has a very high human density of about 400 people per square kilometre and is also home to two thirds of the world\u2019s Asian elephants. As societies in the global north developed, they wiped out the large mammals that competed with them. But this has not happened in India, perhaps on account on Hinduism and strong religious attachments to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_depictions_of_elephants\">a host of animals</a>. Elephant gods feature prominently in Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism across Asia, as Ganesha, Ganapati, Airavata or Vinayaka in India, Erawan in Thailand, and Kangiten in Japan, all broadly thought of as the \u201cremover of obstacles\u201d. As <a href=\"http://www.moef.nic.in/downloads/public-information/ETF_REPORT_FINAL.pdf\">the Indian government\u2019s elephant taskforce notes</a> (pdf), it is \u201cnot the immediate extinction as much as attrition of living spaces and the tense conditions of the human-elephant encounter on the ground that require redress\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"71c61208819be2ea605e4ea9d59010fad0079a43\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71c61208819be2ea605e4ea9d59010fad0079a43/0_0_2663_1861/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mourners gather after a local is killed by an elephant in the village of Baghasole, West Bengal\" width=\"1000\" height=\"699\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mourners gather after a local is killed by an elephant in the village of Baghasole, West Bengal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As well as religion, the community\u2019s wider culture plays a part. Developed western societies, including elite communities in the global south, largely ascribe to the Judeo-Christian worldview, where \u201cman\u201d is at the pinnacle of creation, and able to dominate nature. Saving wildlife is an act of benevolence, compassion or duty. Indigenous communities see themselves more as a part of nature, and think of various plants, animals, inanimate object and even natural phenomena as \u201cmore than human\u201d people with whom they are able to interact and communicate. Individual animals can be eaten for food so long as there is respect, and individual animals are capable of wrongdoing, and liable to be punished \u2013 but animals in general have as much right to exist as humans. </p> <p>This is not universal, however: <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Adrian_Treves/publication/228594746_The_Social_Dimensions_of_Human-Elephant_Conflict_in_Africa_A_Literature_Review_and_Case_Studies_from_Uganda_and_Cameroon/links/00463529358d7cba1a000000.pdf\">reports from Africa</a> suggest a lot more animosity and fear towards elephants among the farmers and local communities who share space with them, and none of the cultural reverence. \u201cRogue elephants\u201d that kill people are often put down by the governments in many African nations \u2013 something that almost never happens in Asia.</p> <p>***</p> <p>To have any hope of managing human-elephant interactions, we need to understand what makes elephants tick. Let\u2019s start with their idea of home. Through the year, a herd of elephants may move over a very large area in search of food and water \u2013 sometimes more than 1,000 square kilometres. (There may also be a \u201ccultural\u201d element to these journeys, with generation after generation used to making them.) The \u201chome ranges\u201d are invariably larger than the protected area in which elephants are supposed to live, and the movement between wildlife parks makes interactions with people almost inevitable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"074c4ae889c2fcdaf3ce4cad0680f4a4ecc96cd1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/074c4ae889c2fcdaf3ce4cad0680f4a4ecc96cd1/0_0_3500_2321/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A villager puts flowers on the bodies of two female elephants, found electrocuted next to an electricity pole on the outskirts of Siliguri.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A villager puts flowers on the bodies of two female elephants, found electrocuted next to an electricity pole on the outskirts of Siliguri in West Bengal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Diptendu Dutta/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But newer research is also showing that in Sri Lanka, where the government has created more permanent water bodies for people, elephants are also using these, and their ranges have shrunk, sometimes to less than 100 square kilometres. This is also happening in the region where I work \u2013 when there is enough food and water all through the year, elephants tend to become much more sedentary. It will be important to study this aspect of elephant biology in years to come, particularly given climate and other human-induced changes.</p> <p>Most elephants continue to move across vast areas, however, and allowing for this is critical. Governments and NGOs increasingly favour the idea of \u201ccorridors\u201d, which make it easier for elephants to move between isolated habitats. In theory, these operate on two levels. First, they assist the regular movement of elephants within their range, despite manmade obstacles such as busy roads and railway lines, newly enlarged villages and even national borders. There may be hundreds or thousands of such points all over the elephants\u2019 range, each needing very site-specific interventions to mitigate the problem. Corridors can also preserve genetic connectedness between two populations of elephants, by allowing the occasional individual to get across to mate. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"64f3816bbe8b9ca100be8460fc291ba9771622f0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/64f3816bbe8b9ca100be8460fc291ba9771622f0/0_224_5334_3202/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Armed with a makeshift spear, an Assam man sets out to chase away the elephant that crushed a woman to death in the village of Galighat.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Armed with a makeshift spear, an Assam man sets out to chase away the elephant that crushed a woman to death in the village of Galighat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Altaf Qadri/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Contrary to popular belief, however, corridors are not a silver bullet that will solve all the problems of HEC. Generally, corridors are understood as narrow strips of forest that connect two bigger elephant habitats, on the notion that maintaining these passages will ensure peaceful movement. That\u2019s not how elephants travel, however, and the assumption that elephants will stick to the forested strip is simplistic. What people leave as forest could be sparse hill slopes, and the elephants may well prefer to move through farmlands and feed on succulent crops as they go.</p> <p>This bring us to another inconvenient truth: elephants are inherently predisposed to eating crops. In contiguous forests, they spend 12-18 hours a day feeding on a range of grasses, shrubs and leaves. But when they have settlements and agriculture around them, they quickly learn that they can meet their needs in a few hours among the crops.</p> <p>This is particularly true of males. Both African and Asian elephants live in female-led herds, with the males generally leaving when they reach puberty. Young bulls usually form loose bonds with older males, or remain solitary, and tend to crop-raid to a greater extent. Having to fend only for themselves, they can afford to be more reckless in their interactions with humans. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"22c87668eb5d9063597b5426614a3c93abee82f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/22c87668eb5d9063597b5426614a3c93abee82f8/0_34_5006_3005/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An electric fence separates elephants and humans at the Udawalawe wildlife sanctuary, Sri Lanka.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An electric fence separates elephants and humans at the Udawalawe wildlife sanctuary, Sri Lanka.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eranga Jayawardena/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Reckless, perhaps, but definitely not stupid. Elephant brains are similar to humans\u2019 in terms of structure and complexity, with as many neurons. They are able to use tools, learn quickly and cooperate in complex tasks. They are one of the few animals that are self-aware and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_test#Proboscidea\">recognise themselves in mirrors</a>. They are even able to do basic arithmetic beyond what any other non-human species are capable of. They live for as long as humans, and, being highly social, they learn from each other. </p> <p>They have been observed to be altruistic, even to humans. There is a story of a tusker in central India that smashed down a house, trapping a screaming baby. He came back and carefully moved all the rubble away to free the infant. </p> <p>Elephants are also the only other species known to sometimes have rituals around death. Some years ago, I saw an accident ahead of me while driving through a forest in south India. Two young boys on a motorbike had come too close to an elephant, and one had been crushed to death by the scared or angry animal. What struck me was how agitated and upset the elephant seemed. It stood over the body, almost being protective, and was covering it with grasses, branches and mud \u2013 as if attempting a burial. It\u2019s not just intelligence; there is also empathy. All of this makes it clear that elephants are capable of collectively thinking and acting in ways that we are not close to fully understanding.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f001fb21aafab02e017e19dcdf065a47791d8375\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f001fb21aafab02e017e19dcdf065a47791d8375/0_0_5616_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A bull elephant approaches a lodge in Tsavo, Kenya.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A bull elephant approaches a lodge in Tsavo, Kenya.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Cayless/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mind you, even elephants may find other elephants confusing. Biologists tend to generalise for the entire species, assuming all their decisions are made based on their need for food and water, and to increase evolutionary fitness. This is of course an important factor, but it\u2019s not the whole picture. Each elephant is a thinking individual, and they are often very different from each other.</p> <p>This is the focus of my current work. In the landscape in which I work, in south India, a large tuskless male known as CMK1 or \u201cNaadodi Ganesan\u201d, \u201cthe village loafer Ganesan\u201d, spends all his time around people and displays behaviour that is rather different from his fellow elephants. He almost never becomes agitated or attacks \u2013 we\u2019ve even seen children herding him along as they do cattle. He walks along main roads, and often gets an official escort from the police and forest departments, largely to keep excited people away from him. Other elephants in the same region, interacting with the same people, are very shy and stay away from settlements. And there is a third type that is often seen near habitations, but is highly agitated around people. Some of these elephants have been responsible for a majority of human deaths. Understanding this individuality is of particular importance in tackling HEC.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Humans, too, are anything but uniform. This is an area that has received very little attention in the scientific literature on HEC. Most research is done by biologists, whose research often excludes the human dimension. Yet agriculturalists, for example, clearly have a lot more to lose on account of elephants than pastoralists and herders, and hunter-gatherers perhaps even less.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b3c89a4f2a35f56a9e26c099d2fc9e91bd14d9ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3c89a4f2a35f56a9e26c099d2fc9e91bd14d9ad/0_189_4608_2765/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018CMK1\u2019 and his escort on a road in India\u2019s Gudalur region.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Local celebrity \u2018CMK1\u2019 and his escort on a road in India\u2019s Gudalur region.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shola Trust</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While most of the early research on HEC focused on quantifying the economic and other losses that people suffered, much of the newer work argues that what is more important is perceived loss. If a person is highly tolerant of animals and thinks it natural that some of their crops will be eaten by elephants, does that count as conflict or not? This is very evident in the Gudalur area, with newer arrivals finding it a lot harder to live with elephants than the indigenous people. The Kattunayakans, for example, a traditional hunter-gatherer tribe, would never plant a cash crop like bananas, since \u201celephants would eat it, of course\u201d. They think it\u2019s perfectly natural for elephants to come through their land and eat whatever they find. But for many of the newer immigrants into the region this is completely unacceptable, and they think elephants are a huge problem. </p> <p>Such nuances are frequently lost on biologists, conservationists and the media. They count all interactions as conflict, and almost create conflict where there is none. </p> <p>***</p> <p>So why is human-elephant conflict now seen as such a big problem? Elephants have always moved over large distances, and arguably had some negative impact on the people they interact with. There is no hard data to show that conflict is sharply on the rise; this is something that is inferred more from the increasing number of media reports and scientific publications about \u201cconflict\u201d. As the world becomes more connected, humans may also be becoming less tolerant as they hear more about damage caused by elephants. This is very evident in south India where I work \u2013 even among people living alongside elephants, perceptions are often formed more from media reports than from their own interaction with the animals. </p> <p>As for what\u2019s causing any rise in HEC, opinion seems to be split between two camps. The majority view, particularly in the western and English-language media, is from the elephant\u2019s perspective: we humans are continually destroying forests across the world and encroaching into the elephants\u2019 habitat, so we shouldn\u2019t be surprised when elephants eat crops or injure people. This is of course true. But a contrary, minority view also exists \u2013 that with strong laws protecting elephants, their numbers are increasing in some areas, and they are venturing into human habitation like never before, causing unbearable losses to local communities. This too is true, and a heated debate continues. We are undoubtedly continuing to destroy vast tracts of elephant forests around the world, but many well-managed populations are flourishing. The savannah elephant populations in southern Africa, in particular, have recovered considerably in the last few decades thanks to concerted conservation efforts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"329ef5b710b5d5981610c3001c6de6da47809419\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/329ef5b710b5d5981610c3001c6de6da47809419/0_0_1618_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elephants stuck in fence\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Elephants have a host of ways to defeat fences.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kraiyut Suksawat/Getty Images/EyeEm</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As far as elephant numbers are concerned, surprising as it seems, the global population figures published by the International Union for Conservation of Nature are based on vague guesswork and crude estimates. The logistics of coordinating elephant surveys across 50 nations are beyond any international conservation organisation. Countries therefore conduct their surveys independently, at different times and using slightly different methods, making it impossible to collate the numbers accurately. For Asian elephants, in both India and Sri Lanka, official numbers point to an increasing population, but the counting methods have evolved over the years, making older estimates less accurate. For African elephants, it\u2019s still more complicated, since both the area to be surveyed and the numbers are much greater.</p> <p>The destruction of forests is less debatable, and almost all the data points to a drastic decline in the last few decades, with the trends sadly continuing, particularly in central Africa and south-east Asia. In addition to the actual destruction of forests, there is degradation. <em>Lantana camara</em>, for example, is one of the world\u2019s top 10 invasive plants. Native to the central and southern Americas, it\u2019s a thick shrub that out-competes everything else in a forest and is a huge problem across almost all of the tropics. Its leaves contain toxins, and cannot be eaten by herbivores. We haven\u2019t ascertained how much of the forests it has taken over, but a significant portion may in reality be unpalatable weeds and effectively unusable from an elephant\u2019s perspective.</p> <p>***</p> <p>What is being done to reduce HEC? Barriers such as elephant-proof trenches and electric fences are the most popular options across Africa and Asia. But they are very expensive \u2013 a key constraint for developing countries. More importantly, elephants usually manage to get across them in a short while. In areas that get high rain, trenches fill up with eroded soil after the first monsoon. Elephants have also been known to stamp at the edges and push mud into the trenches in order to fill and cross them. They have a host of ways to defeat fences; the favourite is to step on posts and push them down, or to push trees or dead wood into a fence and knock it over. They also learn that their tusks don\u2019t conduct electricity, and use them to snap the wires. An experiment in Kenya tried trimming tusks to stop this behaviour, but the de-tusked elephants went on to break 20 fences in five days.</p> <p>Elsewhere, humans sometimes do the elephants\u2019 work for them, taking down fences so their livestock can graze in restricted areas. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c984f5fb285551b0180dcbf1bfd346ddfc827662\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c984f5fb285551b0180dcbf1bfd346ddfc827662/0_13_3500_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An elephant grazes near an electric fence in Udawalawe wildlife sanctuary.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An elephant grazes near an electric fence in Udawalawe wildlife sanctuary.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ishara S Kodikara/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Both fences and trenches tend to do a better job of keeping elephants out than of keeping them in. They work quite well around individual landholdings, but less so around villages or common agricultural land, where no one person is responsible for the upkeep.</p> <p>Financial compensation is the other key element of HEC mitigation that is being widely used, supported by a number of conservation groups. While this is often crucial for impoverished families who lose their whole year\u2019s income to elephants in a single night, this approach also has its shortcomings. The major criticism is that it acts as a perverse subsidy that <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.2193/0022-541X(2005)069%3c0014:WCWDMB%3e2.0.CO;2\">disincentivises farmers from protecting their fields</a>. It also shifts the problem from it being each farmer\u2019s responsibility to protect their crops to it being the government\u2019s responsibility to keep elephants inside forests.</p> <p>Various NGOs are pushing more \u201corganic\u201d fences, particularly beehive and chilli fences, that act as soft rather than hard barriers. They have met with some success, and seem to be growing in popularity, particularly in Africa. But they are not permanent solutions, and fail in as many cases as they succeed. Keeping bees or cultivating chillies involves people taking on a new livelihood, and comes with a host of complications, such as a drought where the bees have no flowers, or a disease that affects the bees or chillies. It works when there is external funding, but often collapses when that stops.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f9f6fec302cb4b8c799c24f7d85d47dde2520a65\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f9f6fec302cb4b8c799c24f7d85d47dde2520a65/0_191_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A male elephant charges Indian villagers at Kolabari, some 50km from Siliguri in West Bengal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A male elephant charges Indian villagers at Kolabari, some 50km from Siliguri in West Bengal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Diptendu Dutta/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A text message-based <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/29/indian-conservationist-wins-whitley-award-for-saving-elephants-via-sms\">early warning system</a> has also been implemented in some parts of south India. Informing people in advance about elephants\u2019 presence is showing considerable promise in reducing human deathss.</p> <p>Last but not least are the numerous and complex \u201ctraditional\u201d mitigation strategies \u2013 beating drums, small fires and smoke screens, chasing elephants, firecrackers, intricate trip wires and alarms. All of these work to varying degrees. The common thread running through all of them is that they depend on the ingenuity and time of the local people, and require nothing external. They are not advocated by big conservation NGOs and government agencies, which are all looking for a single large-scale solution. But they should be encouraged and enhanced.</p> <p>***</p> <p>As mentioned before, human-elephant conflict is essentially driven by the same forces as the rest of the ecological crisis \u2013 we humans are consuming too much and our population is growing. The threat to forests and other natural habitats comes less from the people who live in them, and more from global corporations and the economic engine that\u2019s driving the world. Vast tracts of rainforests are being destroyed for oil palm plantations and industrial agriculture; mining and fossil companies are churning the earth; dams, roads and power lines are slicing up natural ecosystems. Conservationists should be targeting these processes and economic systems, but are increasingly dependent on the corporations for funding.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"835758fecc9e5668ca5bebd870d2bbccd4b4458f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/835758fecc9e5668ca5bebd870d2bbccd4b4458f/0_0_5514_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A beehive barrier on a farm near near Voi in southern Kenya.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"696\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A beehive barrier on a farm near near Voi in southern Kenya.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Until that changes, what can we do to help humans and elephants share space? For a start, we might do away with the term \u201cconflict\u201d. It implies an active antagonism between the two species, and that is simply not the case. In our fieldwork at the <a href=\"http://www.thesholatrust.org/\">Shola Trust</a> we\u2019ve found that even people who have had family killed usually see it as an accident, and don\u2019t hold a grudge against the elephants. When we observe elephants we invariably have an entourage of local people with us, all taking time off from their work to watch and animatedly discuss the animals. Something positive is clearly gained in interacting with elephants, yet conservationists assume all interactions are \u201cconflict\u201d. This negative vocabulary is having a real and significant impact on people who share space with elephants, and making them less tolerant. </p> <p>Aside from the question of vocabulary, we have to learn from communities that have been living with elephants for centuries. Too many conservation interventions do the opposite. Indigenous peoples are enticed into \u201cvoluntary relocation\u201d away from the forests, have fences built round them, are encouraged to grow cash crops, are given skills training and urged to take up modern jobs. This may often be completely justified and driven by the communities themselves \u2013 but sometimes only lip service is paid to the \u201cfree, prior and informed consent\u201d demanded by the United Nations permanent forum on indigenous issues.<br></p> <p>And we must be flexible. From the beehive barriers to the corridors to the electric fences, all of the strategies described above are being used widely across the world, with varying degrees of success and failure. The literature is full of uni-dimensional studies that measure the effectiveness of one mitigation strategy or another, without considering the gamut of ecological, social, economic and cultural contexts within which the strategy is implemented. The quest to find a universal \u201csolution\u201d to HEC continues, but the real answer may be to accept that there is no universal solution. Each may work in one place, and fail in another, or work for some time, then fail at a later date. The problem is better understood as an interface between people and elephants, with both sides constantly learning and innovating. It\u2019s a relationship that will be defined by improvisation by both humans and elephants. We need thousands of different solutions all over the world, continuously changing and evolving.</p> <ul> <li><em>Tarsh Thekaekara is a PhD student at the Open University and a researcher at the <a href=\"http://www.thesholatrust.org/\">Shola Trust</a>.</em><br></li> <li><em>This piece is part of a year-long series on Elephant Conservation \u2013 email us at <a href=\"mailto:elephant.conservation@theguardian.com\">elephant.conservation@theguardian.com</a></em></li> </ul>", "wordcount": "4020"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "environment/2017/jan/03/do-david-attenboroughs-programmes-help-or-hinder-the-natural-world", "type": "article", "sectionId": "environment", "sectionName": "Environment", "webPublicationDate": "2017-01-03T18:33:15Z", "webTitle": "Do David Attenborough\u2019s programmes help or hinder the natural world? | Letters", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jan/03/do-david-attenboroughs-programmes-help-or-hinder-the-natural-world", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/jan/03/do-david-attenboroughs-programmes-help-or-hinder-the-natural-world", "fields": {"byline": "Letters", "body": "<p>It takes a brave man to take a shot at a national treasure, and they don\u2019t come any more treasured than David Attenborough, so hats off to Martin Hughes-Games for bravery (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/01/bbc-planet-earth-not-help-natural-world\" title=\"\">Why Planet Earth II should have been taxed</a>, 2 January). But I fear he\u2019s wrong. He says programmes like Planet Earth II lull us \u201cinto a false sense of security\u201d as wildlife species are decimated across the globe. That is almost certainly correct, but one thing we\u2019ve learned from last year\u2019s EU referendum is that ordinary people just don\u2019t listen to \u201cexperts\u201d lecturing them about unfolding, manmade disasters. Planet Earth II, with its beauty and grandeur, and, yes, entertainment value, takes a subtle approach worthy of the most sophisticated advertising campaign: it says, look at this marvellous planet, do you really want to allow its destruction? <br><strong>Peter Lyth</strong><br><em>Hockerton, Nottinghamshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 At last, someone has dared to say it. I&#xa0;strongly agree with Martin Hughes-Games with reference to the series Planet Earth I and II. Presenting these programmes was a man who has integrity, presence and an attractive air of authority. People admire him and listen to him. Sir David Attenborough was (and is) in an almost unique position to tell it as it is, not how we would all like it to be. These nature programmes were brilliantly produced with extremely skilful photography and, yes, it was great entertainment. But unfortunately it told a very cosy story with scant allusion to what is really happening. Ignorance, greed, unsupportable population growth of our species and a curious assumption that we can trash the planet without consequences. There is only one point on which I would disagree with Hughes-Games. In 100 years\u2019 time, I don\u2019t believe anyone will be thinking or caring about wildlife. By then, it may well be apparent that the journey towards our own extinction had begun in earnest. Probably far too late to exit la-la land.<br><strong>Carol Knight</strong><br><em>Tisbury, Wiltshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Martin Hughes-Games\u2019 claim that Planet Earth II has done nothing to further global conservation gets to the heart of the problem with the BBC Natural History Unit, that its programmes are made with money, ratings and global sales in mind rather than conservation. It is a sad fact that in over 50 years of making wonderful wildlife programmes, it has never made a globally successful big budget series about our destruction of the natural world, despite the unit generating huge profits for the BBC. This has been a big disappointment to the global conservation movement who regularly bring the issue up privately but are reluctant to criticise the BBC publicly. In September the BBC <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2016/julian-hector-nhu\" title=\"\">appointed Julian Hector as the head of the unit</a>, a producer who has made his name making very traditional wildlife programmes but who also made the Ivory Wars with Panorama, a hard-hitting programme about the decline of the elephant. It is exactly this type of unique partnership that the BBC Natural History Unit now needs to invest in, and to make it happen conservation organisations should write to Hector in support of Hughes-Games\u2019 idea of a \u201cconservation tax\u201d on its programmes.<br><strong>Nicholas Milton</strong><br><em>Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Congratulations to Martin Hughes-Games for putting his head above the parapet in criticising the wonderfully produced and fascinating Attenborough series as \u201cescapist wildlife fantasy\u201d. I&#xa0;have been a professional biologist for 40 years, but am still not sure what \u201cwildlife\u201d is. I think it harks back to Rousseau and romantic ideas of primitiveness. There was just about no ecosystem unaffected by humans before anthropogenic climate change came as a \u201cdouble whammy\u201d. I have also occasionally criticised the philosophy behind these series to my biologist colleagues, and am generally faced with disbelief.</p> <p>My criticism is different. The programmes follow the Animal Planet view of biodiversity and nature, where living things are almost entirely made up of large animals and land plants. The vast majority of the genetic biodiversity on earth is microscopic, and the former view is overwhelmingly widespread but completely skewed. Of the dozens of major groups of living things, animals are one and land plants are part of another.</p> <p>I would like to offer two sets of New Year challenges.</p> <p>First, to David Attenborough and his team, to produce a similarly wonderful series on Microscopic Life on Earth.</p> <p>Second, to top billionaire entrepreneurs and futurologists (Mr Branson and Mr Musk, are you listening?). We can now buy simple \u201cdigital microscopes\u201d for about \u00a3100 that can easily view insect parts. Within the next couple of years can you make widely available a digital compound microscope for less than \u00a350, which can view single-celled organisms? Every home should have one. That can be followed a few years later with a home DNA sequencer, so that the 2027 Christmas party game can be: how many different types of living things do you have in your kitchen/plantpots/toenails/pond?<br><strong>John J Bolton</strong><br><em>Professor of biological sciences, University of Cape Town</em></p> <p>\u2022 So Martin Hughes-Games has gained publicity for himself by traducing David Attenborough: how shabby. Having just watched Islands on DVD, I hardly recognise the picture Hughes-Games gives. The subtext throughout David Attenborough\u2019s commentary is the fragility of all ecosystems and, in the case of an island crab population decimated by ants, he actually states in so many words that humans have introduced the problem and will have to find the solution. .<br><br><strong>Joanna Bazley</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 Martin Hughes-Games cites humankind\u2019s insatiable need for space as the prime factor behind wildlife extinctions. It was a pity that neither his article or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jan/01/planet-earth-ii-david-attenborough-martin-hughes-games-bbc-springwatch\" title=\"\">your accompanying story</a> on the same day linked it with humankind\u2019s equivalent need for contraception to be freely available. Impoverished countries cannot become better off while their birthrates are too high. Some of our own reluctance to accept refugees surely has to do with our own loss of countryside and wildlife.</p> <p>We should look to see, first, whether planned cuts to local authority finding threaten our own family planning services; second, whether all charities serving third world countries include it where relevant; and, thirdly, how much more international aid could be given to it and maternal and child health services.</p> <p>It is not often that so many problems could be eased by one, and such an easily provided, solution.<br><strong>Helen Haran</strong><br><em>St Albans, Hertfordshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Martin Hughes-Games makes an important point about the \u201cfantasy\u201d view of the natural world. I would like to add two points. If programme-makers are going to adopt a more realistic and pessimistic tone at times, then please also tell us what we as individuals can do to help. I can no longer watch natural history programmes because I feel hopeless and helpless, which isn\u2019t a very productive situation. I\u2019d also like to make the rather obvious point that it\u2019s not just cheetahs and giraffes that we should worry about. Each&#xa0;time we in the UK turn grass, soil and woodland into brick and concrete we&#xa0;too leave less room for the bees, rooks, moles and their food supplies.<br><strong>Neil Blessitt</strong><br><em>Bristol</em></p> <p>\u2022 Martin Hughes-Games is extremely critical of the BBC production Planet Earth II for not emphasising the disastrous worldwide mass extinction taking place. He makes the extraordinary claim that these programmes are \u201ca significant contributor to the planet-wide extinction of wildlife we\u2019re presiding over\u201d.</p> <p>There is no scientific evidence to support this statement. Others claim that such amazing programmes can increase people\u2019s interest in conservation but Mr Hughes-Games says that \u201cthe scientific evidence shows this is nonsense\u201d.</p> <p>The idea that blame for the complex issue of destruction of habitat and the loss of species can be attributed to TV wildlife shows is in itself a profoundly unscientific concept. This is at best, speculation on his part.</p> <p>In fact, most wildlife productions over the past few decades have more than emphasised the depressing loss of our natural world. So why does it continue? Perhaps just giving people depressing statistics about this disaster has not been helpful. Making them feel guilty, miserable and helpless may in fact demotivate and cause loss of interest.</p> <p>It seems to me that to enable people to act, they need to be inspired and Planet Earth II certainly achieved that.</p> <p>After the inspiration, you can then start to mobilise.

The narrative mode is in itself intriguing, as the three siblings sometimes speak collectively, and it is never clear who is speaking or remembering what. Mature readers no doubt consider the Delaneys selfish and silly and amoral, and so they are, but they are captivating. I missed du Maurier entirely as a teenager, put off her possibly by some snobbish remark by my mother or my English teacher, and she cannot be said to be in the front rank: I\u2019ve found other novels by her to be unreadable or kitsch. But this one is unexpected, and fun, and one of her own favourites.</p> <h2><strong>David Nicholls</strong><br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"03de4314471c4c28d27da14ff7d0c789d4c9647a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/03de4314471c4c28d27da14ff7d0c789d4c9647a/0_13_708_1147/617.jpg\" alt=\"Franny and Zooey by Salinger\" width=\"617\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>With the books we love, so much depends on timing. Between the ages of 16 and 22 I read a series of novels that still make up the best part of my all-time favourite list. Often, the books were read and read again in preparation for exams and though I was certainly not uncritical, I was zealously protective of the books I loved and perhaps a more generous and forgiving reader than I would be if I were coming to Hardy or Dickens, Orwell or Scott Fitzgerald for the first time in middle age.</p> <p>I read Salinger\u2019s <em>Franny and Zooey</em> in my late 20s, which I think was about 10 years too late. I loved the book and it remains a favourite, but it\u2019s a novel that could have been custom-built for my 18-year-old self. The self-consciousness, the anguished debates about art and faith and literature, the earnestness and impatience and anxiety about the future, it\u2019s all there. <em>Franny and Zooey</em> is one of the few books that I\u2019ve returned to every year and while I still love it, the voice in my head grows a little more sceptical each time. Is the stuff about religion really so profound? Isn\u2019t there something just a little bit whimsical, precious, self-satisfied about the Glass family? That famous ending still moves me, but is it just a little sentimental? And <em>why are there so many goddam italics?</em></p> <p>At 18, I don\u2019t think any of this would have crossed my mind. It would have been that rare thing, a perfect book. I still treasure it and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve read anything since that has affected me and inspired me as much, both as a reader and a writer. Now I love it for its comedy \u2013 Salinger\u2019s dialogue is wonderful \u2013 for its mocking fondness and as a portrait of a troubled, loving family. But at 18, I would have put the book down and thought <em>that is exactly how I feel</em>.</p> <h2>William Boyd<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"3d4e714d9ef23d918b966c8cc260718b42e1ae77\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d4e714d9ef23d918b966c8cc260718b42e1ae77/59_36_1251_2097/597.jpg\" alt=\"Nabokov King, Queen, Knave\" width=\"597\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I was an avid and undiscriminating reader in my teens: I\u2019d move on to Jane Austen after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/jul/08/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries\">Ed McBain </a>or Nevil Shute. I remember being bowled over by <em>Catch-22</em> and Updike\u2019s <em>Couples</em> and I couldn\u2019t get enough of Sergeanne Golon\u2019s Angelique books. I gave a paper on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/07/f-scott-fitzgerald-id-die-for-you-unpublished-stories-scribner-the-great-gatsby\">Scott Fitzgerald</a> for the school literary society and was asked to vet Nabokov\u2019s <em>Ada</em> to see if it was fit for the library\u2019s open shelves. To be honest, <em>Ada </em>was beyond me, then, but the book I\u2019d give to my teenage self would be another Nabokov \u2013 <em>King, Queen, Knave</em>.</p> <p><em>King, Queen, Knave</em> was originally published in Russian in 1928, only appearing in English 40 years later in 1968, translated by Dmitri Nabokov \u2013 with help from his dad. It\u2019s a classic love triangle: boorish young Franz is seduced by bored Martha, the wife of his smug boss and cousin, Dreyer. The lovers conspire to kill the cuckold but it all goes terribly wrong and Martha dies. The plot is irrelevant. What is brilliant about <em>King, Queen, Knave</em> and why I know it would have been revelatory to my younger self is that it demonstrates how you can be, at the same time, both very funny and very literary. Nabokov\u2019s dark, dark comedy (also a wonderful portrait of Berlin before the Nazis arrived) is exceptionally well written with immaculate precision of language. I don\u2019t think Nabokov ever wrote a funnier novel \u2013 perhaps <em>Pale Fire</em> runs it close \u2013 but the way its world and its denizens are rendered through language is as magisterial and assured as <em>Lolita </em>and <em>Pnin</em>.</p> <h2>Tessa Hadley<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c831564fb6345a1bc9f69513af53151f6a39ae51\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c831564fb6345a1bc9f69513af53151f6a39ae51/310_305_2764_3387/816.jpg\" alt=\"Tessa Hadley\" width=\"816\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tessa Hadley.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colin McPherson/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What I wanted to send back to my younger self, when I first thought about it, was something with a message of restraint.

Hold back, Portia. Wait and see.</p> <p>But that\u2019s ridiculous. As if any teenager would listen to that warning. I read <em>The Death of the Heart</em> in those days anyway, and loved it, and all I took away from it was a passionate identification with Portia, who wanted to live now, not later: risking everything, throwing herself at whatever adventure was passing.</p> <p>So I might as well send back some book with an appetite for life to match those teenage years.

I began with her first book, <em>Pilgrim at Tinker Creek</em>, published in 1974 when she was 28 and which won her a Pulitzer prize the following year. I was 10 that year \u2013 preoccupied with my immediate world, the gecko on my bedroom wall, the small stream at the bottom of the hill, the ant lion as it lay hidden in the sand awaiting the unsuspecting ant. I also thought of God and the universe, and whether the one existed and where the end of the other might be found.</p> <p>Dillard\u2019s book is said to have been inspired by a blind child the author had read about, who saw for the first time after cataracts had been removed. Dillard describes her own walks around a creek near her home in the Blue Ridge mountains of Virginia. Tinker Creek is small, close to a highway, from which floats the sound of traffic and the occasional plastic bag. Yet in Tinker Creek Dillard finds unrestrained beauty and contemplates the infinite through the minutiae of the natural world \u2013 a moth emerging from its cocoon, the unblinking gaze of a weasel with whom she locks eyes. In Tinker Creek she also finds cruelty: the sight of a frog being eaten alive from inside by a giant water bug, \u201chis mouth a gash of terror\u201d. Why God allows cruelty is a question she meditates on throughout.</p> <p>In London, my Tinker Creek was my back garden, where, from my study window, I watched each year\u2019s litter of fox cubs come of age. I watched them while I wrote books, mainly about war. Here in Virginia, not so far from where Dillard lives, my Tinker Creek is a small area of woodland next to my house.</p> <p>There are books that change the way you think, and books that change the way you see the world. But <em>Pilgrim at Tinker Creek</em> is different for being one that reminds the reader of the way she once saw the world, in its purest, though by no means simplest, form. In my middle age her book returned that gift to me. Perhaps if I had been given <em>Pilgrim at Tinker Creek</em> when I was 20, I should never have lost sight of it.</p> <h2>John Banville <br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"71335ebd990c7fe61579bf078a14e7e3e6500125\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71335ebd990c7fe61579bf078a14e7e3e6500125/0_0_1184_1878/630.jpg\" alt=\"Rameau\u2019s Nephew by Denis Diderot\" width=\"630\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rameau\u2019s Nephew by Denis Diderot</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When I published my first book, around the close of the Bronze Age, a kindly reviewer \u2013 PJ Kavanagh, I think it was \u2013 conceded that I had some talent, but added that it was obvious I had been reading the wrong people. He was correct, of course, since I had spent my adolescence wallowing in the post-Romantic excesses of the likes of Dylan Thomas and Lawrence Durrell. It was only when I came across an enthusiastic mention of it in an essay by Lionel Trilling that I was led to one of the most bracingly subversive texts in European literature, <a href=\"https://www.openbookpublishers.com/reader/216#page/34/mode/2up\"><em>Rameau\u2019s Nephew</em>, written in the 1760s by Denis Diderot</a>.</p> <p>This short work, along with <a href=\"https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/english/currentstudents/pg/masters/modules/panromanticisms/kleist_marionette_thatre.pdf\">Kleist\u2019s sublime essay \u201cOn the Marionette Theatre\u201d</a> and <a href=\"http://depts.washington.edu/vienna/documents/Hofmannsthal/Hofmannsthal_Chandos.htm\">Hugo von Hofmannsthal\u2019s Lord Chandos Letter</a>, changed entirely my notions of how and what to write. Rameau\u2019s nephew \u2013 he is not even granted a proper name \u2013 is ironical, vituperative, seething with hysterical self-loathing, and horribly wise to the sordid realities of a world that dismisses true artists in favour of panders, imposters, and mountebanks of all kinds.</p> <p>Diderot, a leader among the encyclop\u00e9distes, was a splendid human being, brilliant, funny and unfailingly wise. If I could reach back and press a copy of <em>Rameau\u2019s Nephew</em> into the hands of my 12-year-old self, what a lot of silliness I would have been saved. But would I have read it, and if I had, would I have understood it?

I could have done with immersing myself in Joseph\u2019s Heller\u2019s bracing, astringent prose. The book is a wild, startling ride through the multiple minds of airmen stuck on a base in Italy in the second world war, but don\u2019t be deceived by the anarchy. Heller knows exactly what he is doing: this is wildness of a highly conscious, deeply cerebral kind. The novel unfolds in a non-chronological, apparently chaotic stream, with a plethora of desperate, war-crazed characters; in Heller\u2019s hands, however, it all builds to a perfectly controlled, precisely timed apotheosis. Don\u2019t all teenagers need a lesson in the art of chanelling chaos?

Similarly with Philip Roth, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/feb/24/a-brief-survey-of-the-short-story-elizabeth-taylor\">Elizabeth Taylor</a> or Kingsley Amis, who I wasn\u2019t much bothered about when young, but who were just perfect for my early middle age. The two books I regret not reading earlier were both things that I\u2019d heard from critics weren\u2019t worth troubling with \u2013 Thackeray\u2019s <em>The History of Pendennis</em> and Conrad\u2019s <em>Chance</em>. Actually, <em>Pendennis </em>is a perfect joy, rueful, funny and forgiving about the disasters of youth. I would have loved to have read it when I was 20. It would have put me right very quickly. And I always loved Conrad, and have no idea why I let Conrad scholars persuade me that this thrilling masterpiece was an inferior work. I didn\u2019t read it until I was nearly 40, and immediately saw that it knew everything about men and women, money and lying, and (an illusion, but a strong one) how to tell a story. It would have saved me a lot of trouble.

I didn\u2019t see anything remotely at odds in having these dual aspirations. As an adult, very little has changed. I am, by nature, expressive and repressive in equal measure \u2013 uninhibited but deeply disciplined. I think this weird disparity is what fuels who I am as a writer.</p> <p>I have always been fascinated by outsiders, and for me, saints are apotheoses of outsiderdom.

These were strange years. My discipline and indiscipline became tangled and embedded. I turned dark. And I suffered. But my suffering felt hollow and meaningless.</p> <p>Saints are broadly considered to be \u201cgood people\u201d, but this definition barely scratches the surface of what they are and do. Sainthood is suffering. It is self-negation: pain with purpose. The saint I love best is <a href=\"http://faithpub.com/st-faustina-secretary-divine-mercy\">Faustina, \u201cGod\u2019s Secretary\u201d</a>; uneducated, Polish, she died in obscurity in 1938.

I sat in a park in the middle of Milan and read this book (Penguin edition with the enigmatic blue Matisse cut-out on the front) until the light had gone and I could barely see the page. De Beauvoir\u2019s intelligent, enigmatic and fantastically calm presence staved off loneliness, hunger, worry about the future \u2013 in fact the sense of confidence and liberation it gave me was giddying, sublime.

Linnartz says that many Dutch people objected to \u201cnature development\u201d 30 years ago but rewilding principles are now mainstream. \u201cWe have wolves coming into the Netherlands again and we are much, much smaller than Britain. If the Dutch can do it, everybody can do it.\u201d</p> <p>In Britain, the movement ignited by writer and environmental activist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/georgemonbiot\">George Monbiot</a> is popularly seen to seek the return of extinct carnivores \u2013 bears, wolves and lynx. In practice, this large-scale restoration of wildlife is returning more modest herbivores to the countryside. Since 2001 at Knepp, Burrell has set free wild herbivores \u2013 konik ponies, longhorn cattle, red deer and Tamworth pigs \u2013 to mimic the grazing of extinct aurochs, wild boar and wild horses.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b08124548d9eb3c7c2766e444b26ba32d19ada94\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b08124548d9eb3c7c2766e444b26ba32d19ada94/0_297_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Deer on the Knepp Castle estate, West Sussex.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Deer on the Knepp Castle estate, West Sussex.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Knepp Safaris</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nature has bounced back astonishingly quickly. Barren monocultures of maize have been replaced with a landscape that looks more like African savannah. The Knepp Castle estate boasts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/12/purple-emperor-jewel-wildland-butterfly-country-diary\">more purple emperor butterflies</a> than anywhere in Britain. It\u2019s thought to be the only place in the country where Britain\u2019s fastest-declining bird, the turtle dove, is increasing in number, with at least 16 pairs this summer. It\u2019s a hotspot for endangered nightingales. The air is thick with birds of prey \u2013 elusive long-eared owls, hobbies and one of the country\u2019s only tree-nesting peregrine falcons.</p> <p>A few rewilding purists scoff at reintroducing herbivorous free-roaming livestock but ecologists say that rewilding\u2019s key principle is to replace conservation \u201cmollycoddling\u201d with \u201crestoring natural processes\u201d \u2013 allowing a landscape and its plants and animals to run wild. For decades, ecologists believed the end result would be dense forest \u2013 and a mass extinction of sun-loving wild flowers and butterflies \u2013 but this dogma has been demolished by Dutch ecologist <a href=\"https://springcollege.org/teachers/frans-vera/\">Frans Vera</a>. Since the 1980s Vera has introduced wild cattle, horses and red deer to 4,000 hectares of rewilded marshland at <a href=\"http://www.holland.com/global/tourism/destinations/provinces/flevoland/oostvaardersplassen-2.htm\">Oostvaardersplassen</a> nature reserve, and proven that \u201cnatural\u201d grazing creates a more dynamic landscape, a constantly changing mosaic of open glades and wooded groves.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/26/british-stork-cities-greek-towns\">Why it\u2019s time to bring back the great British stork | Patrick Barkham</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the Highlands, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/19/-sp-rewilding-large-species-britain-wolves-bears\">rewilding is taking a different form</a> as large landowners such as the Danish owner of <a href=\"http://www.glenfeshie.scot/Glenfeshie_Welcome.html\">Glenfeshie estate</a> and Paul Lister at <a href=\"http://www.alladale.com/\">Alladale</a> restore ancient Caledonian pine forest by culling the historically unprecedentedly high numbers of red deer. But David Balharry, former Scotland director of <a href=\"http://www.rewildingbritain.org.uk/\">Rewilding Britain</a>, cautions that rewilding in Scotland will only be championed by policymakers and politicians when it is led by local communities.</p> <p>For Burrell at Knepp, rewilding has been a pragmatic way to revive the struggling family farm. Ecotourism makes as much profit as his conventional farming business once did. And with Brexit looming, Burrell\u2019s diversified business is no longer dependent on the disappearing EU subsidy regime.</p> <p>Knepp\u2019s unproductive heavy clay meant Burrell could not compete with globalised food production. The government\u2019s inevitable post-Brexit slashing of farm subsidies could make hundreds of similarly \u201cmarginal\u201d farms unprofitable. Burrell\u2019s profits may be steady while conventional dairy and cattle farm incomes fall off a cliff but no farmers have yet followed his example.</p> <p>\u201cIt takes a new eye to look at this and say, \u2018that\u2019s beautiful\u2019, rather than go, \u2018that\u2019s just a real mess\u2019,\u201d says Burrell. \u201cOther farmers may have a moral attitude towards it too \u2013 why are you stopping food production?\u201d Burrell produces 75 tonnes of organic free-range meat each year but many farmers criticise rewilding for abandoning productive farmland when the world\u2019s population is growing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"46dbbb4f488ae3e3f27fac617ec6fc49b056e98c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46dbbb4f488ae3e3f27fac617ec6fc49b056e98c/0_262_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The purple emperor thrives on rewilded farmland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The purple emperor thrives on rewilded farmland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.rewildingeurope.com/tag/wouter-helmer/\">Wouter Helmer</a>, rewilding director of Rewilding Europe, sees no conflict between food production and rewilding: Europe is heading for a future of food produced more intensively in fewer areas, releasing less productive arable land for rewilding, he says. \u201cFarming is being done by fewer and fewer farmers on a larger scale on the best soils. They leave the less profitable lands \u2013 the Scottish Highlands or continental marshlands and river deltas become adventure land for an increasingly urban population.\u201d</p> <p>Helmer says there is no point in seeking to feed the world with traditional organic farming because there is no one to do the labour: when he asks Dutch students who wants to farm, none raise their hands. \u201cThey have a completely different relationship to nature to their parents or grandparents. They are not fighting with it on a daily basis. On one hand they are disconnected from nature but on the other hand they are becoming more relaxed with nature \u2013 it\u2019s hunting and gathering but hunting with a camera and gathering experiences. Corporate training or meetings are held outside. The part of the countryside which is not used for intensive farming starts to serve all these new urban needs.\u201d</p> <p>At the Knepp conference, ecology professors reported that students were newly inspired by rewilding but some environmentalists worry how it connects with urban populations. \u201cThe challenge is how to make rewilding an issue that people in their ordinary lives can take action on,\u201d says Elaine Gilligan of Friends of the Earth. \u201cIt has a real wow factor for engaging people in nature but how can rewilding be taken to the streets of Birmingham?\u201d</p> <p>Rewilders argue that reducing flood risks for cities is one practical way rewilding can enhance urban life. The <a href=\"http://www.yppartnership.org.uk/\">Yorkshire Peat Partnership</a> is restoring 30,000 hectares of upland bogs which act as giant sponges for floodwater. Conservationists are also working with Leeds city council on proposals to rewild the upper river Aire \u2013 adding meanders, planting trees and creating new washlands \u2013 to reduce the floodwater flows through Leeds.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2017/jun/22/great-british-bee-count-2017-in-pictures\">Great British Bee Count 2017 \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As well as reducing flood risk, rewilding alleviates soil erosion, says Ted Green, founder president of the <a href=\"http://www.ancienttreeforum.co.uk/\">Ancient Tree Forum</a>. Intensive farming can worsen flash flooding, and cause fertile soils to be swept out to sea. \u201cThe land may belong to the landowner but the soil must belong to the nation,\u201d says Green. \u201cWe are fertilising the ocean. When you see people cleaning out their houses after floods, you don\u2019t see them removing water, you see them removing mud. If we used the word \u2018mud\u2019 instead of floodwater, it\u2019s no longer an engineering problem \u2013 it\u2019s a farming problem.\u201d</p> <p>As conventional conservation jumps on the rewilding bandwagon, Miles King, founder of the charity <a href=\"http://peopleneednature.org.uk/\">People Need Nature</a>, fears it could become a cliche. A project to release water voles into Northumberland was recently described as rewilding. \u201cThat\u2019s just a basic conservation project,\u201d says King. \u201cThe risk is you end up rebadging all these conventional nature conservation activities as rewilding in the hope that people take an interest. We need to avoid being sucked into that.\u201d</p> <p>And some conservationists worry that rewilding could replace the traditional protection of rare species on small nature reserves. \u201cIf rewilding really takes off there\u2019s a risk people will say, \u2018Oh we don\u2019t have to do any of that old stuff,\u2019\u201d says Matt Shardlow, <a href=\"https://www.buglife.org.uk/about-us/whos-who\">chief executive of Buglife</a>. \u201cBut we still have habitat fragmentation and species in tiny places and we have to take care of them even if you have some areas made bigger for wildlife.</p> <p>\u201cIf in 100 years time you have a Knepp in every parish, maybe some species can come off the endangered lists and won\u2019t need such precious care.\u201d</p> <p>As turtle doves purred in the burgeoning thickets at Knepp, the conservationist Sir John Lawton, the author of the influential government report, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/making-space-for-nature-a-review-of-englands-wildlife-sites-published-today\"><em>Making Space for Nature</em></a>, led a rallying cry for \u201cmore, bigger, better and joined\u201d wild areas. \u201cWe need more Knepps and Ennerdales. If we can do impressive mid-range rewilding somewhere as close to Gatwick airport as this, we can do it anywhere. This is the south-east of England for crying out loud! Let\u2019s not pretend we can\u2019t make space for nature because we can and we must.\u201d</p> <h2>HOW YOU CAN HELP</h2> <p>Purists wouldn\u2019t call it rewilding but some councils are relaxing their management of verges and parks, letting grass grow longer and allowing wild flower areas to develop. Burnley borough council estimates it is saving \u00a358,000 a year by reducing grass-cutting to benefit wildlife. Councils including Dorset, Devon, Cornwall, East Sussex and Bristol have adopted \u201cpollinator action plans\u201d with strategies for wilder areas to encourage bees and butterflies. Friends of the Earth <a href=\"https://www.foe.co.uk/page/bee-cause\">is campaigning for more local action </a>for on pollinators.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/jun/22/strange-case-disappearing-urban-butterfly\">Flutter bye: where did all the city butterflies go?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Gardeners are unlikely to be able to reintroduce wild boar (rewilders say you need a minimum of 120 hectares to create a large enough area for wild grazing) but we can at least liberate our lawns. Instead of unleashing wild ponies, sow yellow rattle, a flower that is a parasite of grass and creates space for wild flowers and herbs. Long grass is the food plant for butterfly caterpillars including meadow browns, ringlets and marbled whites, and home for grasshoppers and meadow ants that attract green woodpeckers.</p> <p>Many rewilded Dutch reserves are coastal and riverine areas close to cities and towns and some of the most exciting rewilding in Britain is happening on the Thames estuary. The RSPB <a href=\"https://www.rspb.org.uk/reserves-and-events/find-a-reserve/reserves-a-z/reserves-by-name/w/wallaseaisland/\">has returned the arable flatlands of Wallasea Island</a> to salt marsh, while rewilded brownfield <a href=\"https://www.buglife.org.uk/campaigns-and-our-work/habitat-projects/canvey-wick-britains-rainforest\">nature reserves such as Canvey Wick</a> are \u201cbrownfield tropical rainforests\u201d, rich in rare invertebrate species.

On a good day the journey takes just under an hour. Barber, 47, is America\u2019s pre-eminent philosopher chef. He has the reed-thin rigour of a stoic and the endlessly curious palate of a hedonist. He is on a cheerfully insane, one-man mission not only to serve some of the best-tasting food in America, but also to change the way America farms and eats for ever. It would be fair to say this mission is much more than a full-time job.</p> <p>I\u2019d said good night to Barber late the previous evening in the tiny galley kitchen of his Manhattan restaurant \u2013 also called Blue Hill \u2013 where he had laboured to create one of the most innovative and memorable meals I\u2019d ever eaten and from which he was heading home to the apartment a couple of blocks away where he lives with his wife and two daughters, aged three and one. I\u2019d caught up with him again at 7am at the Green Market at Union Square where he was eagle-eyeing what was new, chatting with old-friend farmers and buying carefully selected boxes of red, yellow and sour cherries and baby fava beans and bunches of the coveted salty Italian herb agretti. Some of that produce was now in the back of his car.</p> <p>As the traffic starts to thin out of the city Barber is explaining to me how when he started out in life the plan was never to be a chef but to be a novelist. He was a graduate in English Literature from Tufts University in Massachusetts, and he got his first job in a kitchen \u2013 at the famous La Brea bakery in LA \u2013 to support that ambition. \u201cFor a year or two I would bake at night, work the breakfast line of the restaurant there, go home and sleep a couple of hours, and then wake up and try to write,\u201d he recalls. His novel was never published, but the storytelling impulse never left him. It eventually found its expression a couple of years ago in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/30/books/the-third-plate-by-dan-barber.html?_r=0\">his book <em>The Third Plate</em></a>, a compelling travelogue of his investigations into cuisine and agriculture, which doubles as a manifesto for the future of food.</p> <p>That manifesto argues for a radical shift in what our standard plate of dinner should look like: away from a slab of protein (even if grass-fed) with a side of vegetables (even if organic) and toward a plate of great-tasting vegetables with perhaps a seasoning or a sauce of meat. \u201cThe balance has to change,\u201d he says. \u201cFor all sorts of reasons we shouldn\u2019t be serving a pork chop except on celebratory holidays and special events.\u201d</p> <p>Barber believes flavour has to start with an understanding of soil. His book is a compendium of experiments in how to improve the taste of food through planting and harvesting techniques \u2013 and only afterwards in the kitchen. Most great chefs have made some of those connections, few have taken that understanding to Barber\u2019s logical conclusion: that a cook has a duty to not only know the farmers who provide his or her ingredients, but also to be actively involved from seed to table, by natural selecting for taste.</p> <p><em>The Third Plate</em> makes the argument that great cooking has always started with the stuff that there isn\u2019t a market for. \u201cBouillabaisse, say,\u201d Barber says, \u201cwas damaged fish from the dock that the wives knew the captains couldn\u2019t sell and they created soup. Coq au vin was a clever way of tenderising old roosters.\u201d He dissects how the great cuisines of the world all came from utilising the pairings of foodstuffs that kept the soil fertile over generations: rice and beans in Italy, say. Monocultural farming breaks that relationship, but chefs have some power to reconnect it. \u201cJapan is a rice culture but to get the rice you need buckwheat as a rotation crop,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the United States buckwheat is fed into dog food. In Japan you make soba noodle.\u201d</p> <p>Barber has spread this message in TED talks and editorials; he was on President Obama\u2019s council for health and nutrition; in 2009 <em>Time</em> magazine named him one of the world\u2019s 100 most influential thinkers. Does he feel he is winning that argument at all in America?</p> <p>\u201cNo, I am losing,\u201d he says, with a modest laugh. \u201cI am losing in every way. But I am going to go on making it.\u201d</p> <p>As we talk and drive, Barber\u2019s chat is punctuated by a conversation on the speakerphone with his chef de cuisine, Bastien Guillochon. Listening in to it gives some idea of what is on his mind today.</p> <p>\u201cBastion, do we have enough of the skate wing cartilage?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d Guillochon says, a little doubtfully.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about those eggs that didn\u2019t have fully formed shells? How about we do them with the crushed new potatoes with the sorrel sauce.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d Guillochon mutters, after a moment.</p> <p>\u201cBastion, you don\u2019t sound that psyched?\u201d Barber says. \u201cYou haven\u2019t had coffee yet?\u201d</p> <p>And then to me, quietly self-mocking. \u201cMan, it\u2019s not easy being the creative genius. These tattooed chefs don\u2019t give you anything. Especially the French ones.\u201d</p> <p>He doesn\u2019t stop. \u201cWe could do the pea on the half shell thing we talked about. Or, I know, we could do pea Rockefeller? Like oyster Rockefeller, you know, spinach, cream, egg yolk, \u2018so rich only a Rockefeller could eat it.\u2019 Who said that? Escoffier?\u201d</p> <p>There is a longer pause on the line.</p> <p>Barber thinks some more. \u201cOn second thoughts, Peggy Rockefeller is coming tonight. Maybe it\u2019s not the night to try that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f81461be1da0e800bf65d7e339668ddc82fbfd11\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f81461be1da0e800bf65d7e339668ddc82fbfd11/177_303_3850_2309/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Blue Hill at Stone Barns restaurant\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Blue Hill at Stone Barns restaurant has 80 acres of organic farmland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jen Munkvold</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Barber works every day at Stone Barns without</strong> a menu, to conjure a set-dinner feast of around 30 tasting plates that are served over three or four hours. He has a couple of unique resources at his disposal. The first is that Stone Barns is a sort of teaching hospital for his philosophy. The restaurant is at the centre of 80 acres of organic farmland that is set up to experiment with cultivating new varietals of everything from peppers to rye, all selected for taste. The second resource is his commitment to wasting nothing at all, a state of mind that allows all kinds of possibility.</p> <p>The most eye-catching expression of that determination was a two-week experiment at Blue Hill in Manhattan in 2015. Barber transformed his restaurant into a pop-up called wastED, (the capitalisation signified \u201ceducation\u201d) where he served, triumphantly, \u201cpock-marked potatoes\u201d, \u201ccarrot top marmalade\u201d, burgers made from beetroot pulp and fries repurposed from corn for cattle. The restaurant tables were made from slabs of mycelium, a fungal alternative to plastic. On them, candles flickered, labelled \u201cbeef\u201d: the melted liquid was rendered fat, to be poured on bread, made with by-product malt and grain from craft beer breweries. <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/waste-not-want-not-eat-up\">Critics were almost uniformly seduced.</a> Later that year, Barber made headlines by serving his \u201cwaste food\u201d, including salads made from vegetable scraps, to world leaders meeting at the United Nations in New York.</p> <p>In February, after much labour intensive research he will bring a version of this wastED pop-up concept to London. For a month it will operate from the rooftop restaurant of Selfridges on Oxford Street. He wants to give the restaurant a properly British flavour, so when we talk he is trialling and erroring various possibilities. From a salmon processor he is looking to harvest the rich \u201cbloodline\u201d flesh that gets discarded. He is making enquiries about collecting pulp from organic sugar beet farmers, and talking waste products with sympathetic chicken and dairy farms. \u201cA project like the one I am trying to do at Selfridges couldn\u2019t have existed even 100 years ago,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause there was no waste from agriculture, everything was utilised.\u201d</p> <p>The statistics about what has changed since then are stark: 40% of what farms produce goes into the trash or is unsellable. Some of this is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/17/ugly-fruit-vegetable-delivery-service-food-waste\">\u201cugly\u201d fruit and vegetables </a>and expired dairy. But really, he suggests, the bigger problem is the structure of the diet itself which creates this waste. \u201cIn America we grow 120 million acres of corn that we don\u2019t eat, which leeches the soil and is fed to animals in the most inefficient way. You have heard the expression nose-to-tail eating. What we need to do is really nose to tail of the whole farm.\u201d</p> <p>The model for this practice is at Stone Barns. The farm was created in the 1920s as a kind of bucolic paradise by the Rockefeller family, in order to educate their children about the land \u2013 they used to come at weekends and practise milking in the barns. Barber, who did much of his growing up on his grandparents\u2019 farm 50 miles away (which he still runs with his brother, and which provides most of the dairy produce for the restaurants), has been here for a dozen years. He has a labour-intensive kitchen of about 35, many of whom are seconded from like-minded restaurants around the world. When we arrive at lunchtime, Barber gets straight into briefing these chefs, continuing the conversation from the car.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/13/us-food-waste-ugly-fruit-vegetables-perfect\">Half of all US food produce is thrown away, new research suggests</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Afterwards, when he has got various seasonal experiments rolling in the kitchen, he takes me for a walk in the bucolic hills. The 80 acres of organic land include 10 acres of vegetables and a greenhouse complex. A good deal of what is produced ends up on the restaurant table, but beyond that the farm is a demonstration of Barber\u2019s latest thinking.</p> <p>He starts with the field that was closest to the cow barns. And points to the verdant health of the vegetables in this field even compared to its highly productive neighbours \u2013 because it was close to the barns, the cows most often grazed here. \u201cThe richness of the vegetables here comes from a century of the hooves of the animals crushing seeds and regenerating grass and from all that manure.\u201d</p> <p>The field is a microcosm of the Midwest, Barber suggests, which had \u201ca million years of bison running on the ground and laying manure\u201d. That fertility was the source of America\u2019s great food prosperity. Half a century of intensive grain farming has essentially denuded those million years of soil formation, to the extent that farming can only be sustained with fertiliser and pesticides; the major casualty of this practice, in Barber\u2019s view, is flavour. \u201cScientists select for yield and size, but they never put anything in their mouths.\u201d</p> <p>The antidote to this is an organic system, Barber argues, that allows fields to rest and replenishes soil with rotation crops and occasional grazing. The problem with cover crops, however, is that \u201cno one eats them\u201d. This is something Barber seeks to change. He points out the vetch plants traditionally grown as nitrogen-fixing companion plants to tomatoes and in rotation with grains. He has been using the flowers of the plant to create sweet garnishes. \u201cWe are now cultivating vetch to select for better tasting flowers,\u201d he says. \u201cIt will take a few generations, but it will become a crop in its own right.\u201d</p> <p>He is at work creating similar potential markets for his salad crops, again through selecting the whole plant for flavour. \u201cWe are doing some interesting dishes with salad butts,\u201d he says, of the parts of lettuces that are often discarded. \u201cI think we have to create a culture in which salad butts become sushi.\u201d He talks me through the ways in which they are creating similar revelations in taste with radishes and cucumbers and parsnips and just about everything else.</p> <p>The commitment to using what is grown at the perfect moment of freshness is the reason he doesn\u2019t have menus. \u201cI have to give salad to a lot of people,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t put out a menu and hope people order it. I don\u2019t have a magic wand. I have to take out what is put in.\u201d</p> <p>His luxury is having enough staff to tell stories. \u201cLast night I put on the menu this bok choi that had a flea beetle attack. I had eight crates of it with bullet holes all through it. It couldn\u2019t be sold at a supermarket or a farmers\u2019 market because it looks ugly but it still has amazing flavour. How do I tell that story? I\u2019m lucky to have a waiter to communicate this, but it shouldn\u2019t really need telling. Slicing a tomato isn\u2019t cooking, or heating up a decent piece of beef. But making tripe taste good, or doing something special with this crate of bok choi \u2013 that\u2019s the challenge.\u201d</p> <p>By this time we have reached in our walk the thing for which Barber has become perhaps most famous: his own variety \u201cBarber wheat\u201d. He has developed it over years selecting from heritage grains, using cutting edge cultivation techniques to produce a particular sweet soft bran which is ground whole. If nothing else, he sees the work that has gone into creating the taste of those seeds as his legacy.</p> <p>I wonder at one point how he otherwise measures success.</p> <p>\u201cOne way to read it here is the beehives we passed,\u201d he says. \u201cWe had 20,000 bees when we started. We now have something like a million and a half bees. That is now what the land can support. In 12 years we have made that change.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Walking around Stone Barns in the afternoon </strong>sun<strong> </strong>with Barber this all makes perfect sense but it is the dinner he serves in the evening that clinches his arguments about soil and taste. His \u201cGrazing, Rooting, Pecking\u201d menu featuring the best offerings from the field and market is an eye-watering $238 per head \u2013 though included in that price is a whole new way of thinking about food. That education begins in the most modest way with a little rack of vegetables on spikes, baby carrots, and asparagus and edible flowers and tomatoes, each of the vegetables tasting more of itself than any vegetable you have tasted. It continues in that spirit for 20 or 30 courses \u2013 you quickly stop counting in favour of just enjoying \u2013 that include the skate wing cartilage and unformed eggs and crushed potatoes and excursions out to a signature barbecue of bones and branches and crab shells on which mini \u201cbeetfurters\u201d are grilled. There is a foray into the world\u2019s most alluring \u201cmanure shed\u201d with its open view over the Pocantico hills, for sweet pea gazpacho, and to the kitchen itself for a tasting of Barber wheat breads, concluding with a \u201c200%\u201d wholemeal, (100% wholemeal plus 100% wasted bran) which he has been working on perfecting for two years. The final course is one last experiment \u2013 ice-cream made with colostrum, the rich first milk produced by cattle immediately after calving \u2013 which, like much of the menu, tastes ludicrously better than it perhaps sounds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d96e2ea99ec92f13987e6f1f6e718db0aab5c3a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d96e2ea99ec92f13987e6f1f6e718db0aab5c3a3/338_0_4462_2677/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vegetables on the Fence\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vegetables on the Fence</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andre Baranowski</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While I\u2019m eating, Barber emerges from the kitchen to say that he has just had a call to tell him that the three-star Michelin chef, Antoine Westermann \u2013 a hero of his \u2013 has arrived unexpectedly with a party at the Greenwich Village Blue Hill so he is heading back to help cook for him, and I\u2019m welcome to a lift.</p> <p>We jump in the car and he races as carefully as he can back to the city, now recalling a similar occasion when the Obamas pitched up unexpectedly, now on the speakerphone to the kitchen wondering what Westermann has had to eat so far.

In particular, he wondered \u2013 in <em>On the Origin of Species</em> \u2013 how neighbourhood cats might affect the abundance of flowers in the fields near his house at Downe in Kent. He concluded the animals\u2019 potential to change local flora was considerable.</p> <p>A robust cat population, he argued, would mean that local mouse numbers would be low and that, in turn, would mean there would high numbers of bumble bees \u2013 because mice destroy bee combs and nests. And as bees pollinate clover, Darwin argued that this cascade of oscillating species numbers would result in there being more clover in fields in areas where there are lots of feline pets. Cats mean clover, in short.</p> <p>It was an idea that took the fancy of Darwin\u2019s chief disciple, the biologist Thomas Huxley who extended this cat-clover cascade in 1892 to include old maids. They kept cats, Huxley argued, and those pets would ensure neighbouring fields would be low in mice, high in bees and rich in clover.</p> <p>And that in turn would have powerful consequences for the British Empire, Huxley added. Cattle graze on clover and cattle means beef. Thus old maids would provide the perfect setting for ensuring plenty of clover and therefore healthy cattle and good roast beef to feed our troops and thus ensure the prosperity of the British Empire. Old maids mean military might, in short.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Around islands that lacked sea otters, urchins had increased in size and in numbers with devastating consequences</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Huxley was almost certainly being facetious in outlining his maids\u2011to-empire chain. Nevertheless, the concept of trophic cascades \u2013 as these ladders of interacting predator and prey populations are now known \u2013 is recognised today as being a powerful and important force in shaping the natural history of our planet. More to the point, as human activities impact more and more on wildlife, we are changing trophic cascades with profound and unexpected consequences.</p> <p>This view of nature \u2013 looking down from the top \u2013 contrasts with previous attempts to understand food chains from changes that affect their bottom rungs to see how animals and predators at higher levels are affected. An example of this approach is provided by scientists who study how reductions in Arctic sea ice might reduce levels of algae (which forms on the underside of sea ice) and which might then affect the creatures that consume alga: the plankton, fish and seals further up the food chain.</p> <p>Top-down forcing \u2013 or trophic cascades \u2013 looks at the problem in the reverse direction, with a perfect example being provided by the work of <a href=\"http://werc.ucsc.edu/Estes/Estes_dk.html\">James Estes</a>, an American marine biologist who has studied wildlife in the north Pacific Ocean for the past 45 years and has revealed the astonishing manner in which terrestrial and sea predators can change land and marine environments. This top-down picture \u2013 with predators influencing the health of plants \u2013 is depicted in enthralling detail in his newly published <a href=\"http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520285033\"><em>Serendipity: An Ecologist\u2019s Quest to Understand Nature</em></a> (University of California Press).</p> <p>Estes has spent most of his working life in the Aleutian Islands, which stretch across the North Pacific Ocean from Alaska to the coast of Kamchatka in eastern Russia. \u201cNo place in the modern world is much wilder or more remote than the Aleutians,\u201d he says.</p> <p>This isolation has not put the islands beyond the harmful influence of humans, however. As explorers opened up the far north two centuries ago, hunters pushed deeper into the Aleutians in pursuit of the pelts of the sea otters that thrived there in their hundreds of thousands. A member of the weasel family, the sea otter (<em>Enhydra lutris</em>) keeps warm in the water because it possesses the densest fur in the animal kingdom \u2013 about 850,000 to a million hairs per square inch. This insulates it from the cold.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"25ad5a215cea3f35ffb3ed658dd9046ce53f287b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25ad5a215cea3f35ffb3ed658dd9046ce53f287b/0_308_5120_3072/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sea otters floating in kelp\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sea otters floating in kelp. They help kelp forests to flourish by keeping sea urchin numbers under control.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frans Lanting/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, the sea otter\u2019s thick, rich pelt also made it a major target for hunters who, by the 1900s, had brought the animal close to extinction. \u201cOnly a dozen or so small colonies survived,\u201d Estes tells us. In the end, an international ban on sea otter hunting was imposed, saving the animal from complete eradication.</p> <p>Since then, the sea otter has become an important poster species for the ecology movement: a lovable, cuddly sea mammal that was saved from extinction thanks to international action. They are the teddy bears of the oceans, as one commentator has described them. Filmed as they float on their backs, cracking open sea urchins, crabs, abalones and other shellfish with flat stones before eating them, the animal is certainly an endearing sight.</p> <p>But this constant culinary activity masks a serious issue for the sea otter. An adult animal needs to consume vast amounts of food to survive, about a quarter of its own body weight \u2013 up to 11kg \u2013 every day, hence all that shell crunching and munching.</p> <p>The question that intrigued Estes when he began his marine studies in the Aleutians in the 1970s was straightforward: given its voracious appetite for urchins, crabs and the like, what was the ecological consequence of that calamitous drop in sea otters numbers last century? To find an answer, he began surveying sea floors around islands where sea otters had survived and others where they had disappeared and had yet to be reintroduced.</p> <p>What Estes found was striking: around islands that now lacked sea otters, sea urchins \u2013 their main prey \u2013 had increased in size and in numbers with devastating consequences. The forests of kelp that once grew there in profusion had disappeared. Instead huge urchins littered the barren sea floor, having consumed every kelp plant in sight.</p> <p>By contrast, near islands where sea otters survived or had been reintroduced, kelp flourished. The discovery was important given the nourishment kelp\u2019s underwater forests provide for fish and other sea animals. \u201cKelp forests, with their high biomass and extreme productivity are key controlling elements of coast ecosystems,\u201d says Estes.</p> <p>Everywhere Estes looked he found the same picture. Islands with sea otters had healthy kelp forests while otter-less islands had barren sea floors littered with sea urchins but no kelp. In nearly eradicating sea otters, humans had disrupted a critical trophic cascade: high sea otter numbers that mean low sea urchin populations that mean healthy kelp forests. As Estes puts it: \u201cSea otters are clearly more than \u2018just another brick in the wall\u2019.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0d44f79384c3dac6d98a13b33da70cf31fed3bf7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0d44f79384c3dac6d98a13b33da70cf31fed3bf7/0_113_3428_4285/800.jpg\" alt=\"A sea otter eating a sea urchin\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sea otters use rocks to crack open the spiny shells of sea urchins.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Noel Hendrickson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In fact, they are now recognised as being a keystone species, whose position in food chains is crucial in maintaining the ecological health of an area. They not only ensure the health of kelp forests but affect many other local species, as Estes\u2019s investigations have since revealed. Fish thrive in kelp forests, as do mussel beds, for example.</p> <p>But most of all, those rich kelp forests \u2013 enriched by sea otter activity \u2013 play a key role in maintaining global environmental health. Levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are rising in the sea as well as in the atmosphere, and it is increasingly being absorbed by the sea as well, making it more acidic and harmful to many species. But Estes has calculated that healthy kelp forests have the capacity to absorb billions of kilograms of carbon.</p> <p>\u201cOur results were eye-opening,\u201d he states. \u201cThe difference in annual absorption of atmospheric carbon from kelp photosynthesis between a world with and a world without sea otters is somewhere between 13 and 43 billion kg (13 and 43 teragrams) of carbon.\u201d</p> <p>Just about every strand of ocean life that Estes looked at was touched in some way. \u201cEvery species in the coastal zone is influenced in one way or another by the ecological effects of sea otters,\u201d he concludes. Thus, in removing sea otters from the north Pacific, humanity \u2013 in its pursuit of fur for hats, gloves and coats \u2013 had not only grievously endangered the species, it had disrupted a large chunk of the marine environment in the Pacific and \u2013 for good measure \u2013 damaged our ability to deal with the impact of rising carbon dioxide levels on our planet.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/20/rare-sea-otter-sighting-california\">Rare sea otter sighting offers sign of a resurgence, scientists hope</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fortunately, the species had been saved from extinction in the nick of time. At least that was how it seemed in the 80s and 90s. Then Estes made a second \u2013 disquieting \u2013 discovery. When he returned to the Aleutian islands of Adak and Amchitka \u2013 where sea otter numbers had been steadily rising to the general good of the islands\u2019 kelp forests \u2013 he found their populations were now dwindling. \u201cSomething had changed, but I didn\u2019t know what,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Estes looked elsewhere in the archipelago and found that some sites \u2013 such as Clam Lagoon on Adak \u2013 still possessed healthy populations. Most others showed population declines, however. Overall, about 40,000 sea otters had disappeared over the course of a few years, he calculated. And just as sea otter numbers dropped, so urchins reappeared on the sea floor and kelp forests began to disappear again.</p> <p>But why were sea otters disappearing? Could some toxin or disease be responsible? It seemed unlikely, given that otter losses were affecting islands that were thousands of miles apart and that some sites were completely unaffected by otter losses.</p> <p>The answer was eventually supplied by one of Estes\u2019s colleagues, <a href=\"http://werc.ucsc.edu/Tinker/Tinker_dk.html\">Tim Tinker</a>, who realised two otters that he had recently tagged for future study had gone missing just after a group of killer whales had passed Adak island. Then he recalled that previous losses of tagged otters had also occurred after killer whales had been spotted in the region. Further observations confirmed the idea: killer whales had suddenly taken a shine to sea otter flesh. Only in a few well-protected shallow bays such as Clam Lagoon could the otters escape the attentions of their newfound predators.</p> <p>Given that, prior to 1991, there had been no confirmed attacks by killer whales on sea otters, the discovery was puzzling. So Estes looked at the history of other related species in the region and uncovered a startling picture. Just as sea otter populations started to plunge in the 90s, so those of harbour and fur seals and then sea lions had started to plummet in the 70s and 80s, all targeted by killer whales. But why?</p> <p>The answer, Estes concluded, lay with commercial whaling that was carried out in the region after the second world war. \u201cBefore industrial whaling, killer whales were sustained by feeding on the immense biomass of great whales in the North Pacific and southern Bering Sea,\u201d says Estes. By the time commercial whaling was halted, there were virtually no great whales left for killer whales to eat, and so they expanded their diet first to seals then to sea lions and finally to sea otters. At least that is Estes\u2019s argument. Not every scientist accepts it.</p> <p>Nevertheless the theory is intriguing. The involvement of killer whales means that a new apex predator seems to have appeared at the top of the otter-urchin-kelp trophic cascades and reveals, if nothing else, how this view of the food chain, from the top to the bottom, provides us with an illuminating new way at looking at nature and its tightly interwoven components.

Yet for some reason this wonderful bedding plant is still extremely underused in the UK, despite being ridiculously easy to grow.</p> <p>For starters, rose balsams are incredibly fast germinators, sparking into life in trays on a warm windowsill within just a few days, giving future plant geeks a speedy reward for their first sowing efforts. They are also beautiful, kicking out masses of exotic flowers in a dazzling array of jelly bean-like colours, from peach pink to grape purple in continual succession right up until the first of the hard frosts gets to them.</p> <p>Single-flowered forms are also irresistible to bees, bringing an extra dimension of interest, while helping teach children about science and nature. This is before we mention what is to me the plant\u2019s most fascinating dimension: exploding fruit.</p> <p>At the slightest touch the fussy green seed pods burst open, coiling back their outer layers and firing little brown seeds out in all directions. This is something that gave me hours of entertainment as I pottered through the garden on warm summer days, and quite frankly still does.</p> <p>Their large, easy-to-handle seeds are perfect for little fingers and can be sown at any time from February to May, meaning that you won\u2019t miss your window of opportunity if school, activities or playdates get in the way. Once the risk of frost has passed, these stout, robust plants can be transplanted straight out into beds and borders without any mollycoddling.</p> <p>They are even far less afflicted by the downy mildew that cripples their close relative the busy lizzie,<em> Impatiens walleriana</em>, making them a good substitute for a splash of summer colour.</p> <p>For the really lazy, rose balsams can be sown direct in the garden from May onwards, and plants will even occasionally self-seed from year to year. There\u2019s no need to panic though, the tropical origins of this species means they won\u2019t become a pest like the dreaded invasive Himalayan balsam <em>Impatiens glandulifera</em>.</p> <p>No garden?

Animals or plants could die or suffer excessive stress during relocation, and the impact of animals within an ecosystem receiving the new species must also be considered. There are also socioeconomic implications, if a relocated species were to cause damage to land or pose a threat to humans.</p> <p>\u201cTo me this is not controversial as long as the correct process is followed. Success is not guaranteed, but the alternative of not acting is guaranteed - and that is extinction. We have to remember the reason this is done is primarily because one is trying to avoid extinction, but also because one isn\u2019t able to restore species within their indigenous range because the threats in those zones are so pervasive and can\u2019t be avoided.\u201d</p> <p>The IUCN released <a href=\"https://portals.iucn.org/library/efiles/edocs/2013-009.pdf\">2013 guidelines</a> on conservation translocations, which Moehrenschlager helped to draft. At the moment, there is no formal worldwide regulation or enforcement. \u201cWe encourage a very close planning process that looks at the goals, with evaluation of potential benefits and risks,\u201d he said. </p> <p>The process can mean reinforcing and reintroducing a species within its range - the area it is traditionally found - for example, grey wolves in <a href=\"http://conservationmagazine.org/2014/06/reintroducing-wolves-is-only-effective-at-large-scales/\">Yellowstone national park in the US</a> - or introducing a species outside its native range to boost numbers or replace a function in an ecosystem that has been lost through extinction. </p> <p>Perhaps an underestimated benefit of the method was hope, he said. \u201cIn the space where nature is under increasing threat, restoration of species through conservation translocation can motivate us that the recovery of species is possible and that conservation truly can work.\u201d</p> <h2>Conservation translocations </h2> <p><strong>Californian condor</strong> \u2013 in 1982 only 23 birds survived.

It only arrived in Europe from east Asia in the last 10 years, and the first caterpillars were reported in Britain in 2011.</p> <p><strong>It\u2019s a Chinese invasion! </strong>Probably.

Agriculture is one area of the IoT where there\u2019s little downside, and a host of benefits.</p> <h2><strong>The internet of things next trick? Improving lettuce ...</strong></h2> <p>As it turns out, lettuce isn\u2019t good for everyone. It\u2019s high in potassium, so can be unhealthy for people to eat when on dialysis or suffering chronic kidney disease. To make salads for those with kidney problems, Fujitsu and Microsoft teamed up to grow high-tech lettuce.</p> <p>As odd as it sounds, the project highlights how sensors can be used to help agricultural plants grow faster and better, creating higher yields as well as unique specialisations \u2013 if they can do this with lettuce, imagine <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2012/10/mf-fruition-sciences-winemakers/\">what they can do with wine grapes</a>. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"042f902556ba9a0fafb69ddbce8baec08aea2411\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/042f902556ba9a0fafb69ddbce8baec08aea2411/63_193_5035_3023/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A lettuce\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The potassium in lettuce is bad for people on dialysis or suffering chronic kidney disease.

Indeed, Fujitsu\u2019s test bed is a chip plant that\u2019s been converted to grow IoT-managed plants. \u201cThe information is picked from building sensors that control temperature, humidity, CO2, light intensity and other factors that affect the \u2018perfect conditions\u2019 to grow crops.\u201d That data is handed to Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud, where it\u2019s analysed for reports and to send alerts about its care.</p> <p>All this data means it\u2019s possible to fine tune the conditions to grow low-potassium lettuce. \u201cTo reduce the level of potassium at home, you typically cook the raw vegetables to change their internal chemical composition,\u201d said Andaluz. And who wants cooked lettuce? \u201cFujitsu has been able to produce a raw lettuce with less than 80% of potassium content as compared to traditional grown lettuce.\u201d Thanks to the IoT, crunchy salads for all. </p> <h2>Connected cows</h2> <p>Up there with smart fridges, connected cows are a staple of IoT stories, and with good reason \u2013 the idea of web-connected cows is hilarious.</p> <p>The cows aren\u2019t simply tweeting their position to online followers, however. Under a project run by Dr Jonathan Amory at Writtle College, sensors are tracking dairy cows to help farmers spot illnesses earlier, creating an early-warning system for disease that hopefully cuts suffering for the animals and improves milk yields. The researchers say lameness and diseases such as mastitis cost the dairy industry as much as \u00a3100m annually in the UK alone.</p> <p>\u201cLots of diseases are tricky to spot and time consuming to monitor formally, so having a tool which could flag up cows with possible problems sooner and allow earlier treatment would be really valuable,\u201d said Zoe Barker, the post-doctoral research assistant who runs the project, and is now an expert in sticking sensors to cows.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7f71e291a4079a40070098a6dfdb866132f3591d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f71e291a4079a40070098a6dfdb866132f3591d/0_0_4896_2938/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A cow lying in a field.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Under a project run by Dr Jonathan Amory at Writtle College, sensors are tracking dairy cows to help farmers spot illnesses earlier, creating an early-warning system for disease.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Turner/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For this research, she said the cows were given a collar that included a positioning sensor, with an accelerometer and magnetometer \u2013 though, sadly, no adorable little cow bell.</p> <p>The collars were fitted to a group of more than a hundred cows for six months, with the sensors returning a position on the beasts every 10 seconds, generating data sheets with a million rows of data for each day.</p> <p>Why does it matter where cows are? Simply put, a cow that\u2019s lying down away from the others is more likely to be sick. \u201cWe felt that position was important to understand not only the behaviour of the individual cows but also their social behaviour,\u201d Barker said. \u201cWithout position, it\u2019s not possible to know how the cows are interacting with each other and how this changes with health status or other management influences.\u201d</p> <p>The researchers had to adapt a system that had been used previously to track carts in mines and to follow firefighters \u2013 beasts on a farm is a very different environment indeed. \u201cOnce we sorted the optimum tightness of the neck collars, we reduced the number of whole collars lost by the cows in their shed,\u201d she said. \u201cA bigger issue was the cows ripping the plastic box we were using to house an external battery, and ripping the sensor off of the collar and losing that somewhere in the house.\u201d</p> <p>Cows weren\u2019t the only problem. \u201cIn addition to our destructive cows, the large amount of metal in a modern cow shed caused a moderate reduction in accuracy due to the potential for deflection of radio waves on the metal,\u201d she added.</p> <p>The huge quantity of collected data now needs to be analysed \u2013 mathematicians are creating algorithms, and Barker is in the middle of writing up her paper on the project now \u2013 but the hope is it can be used to predict when cows get sick, she said. \u201cIf we can create the predictive model then we will be able to detect the changes in individual cow behaviour and social behaviour changes that are associated with the onset of disease, and therefore inform the farmer,\u201d she said. \u201cFor diseases such as lameness, where the onset is slow and where clinical symptoms may be masked for a time, we can flag up the issue sooner. Sooner treatment usually means less severe symptoms, less pain, faster recovery and less risk of having a repeat treatment.\u201d</p> <p>These aren\u2019t the only connected cows trodding fields. Alongside its smart lettuce, Fujitsu has given cattle step trackers. \u201cBy using pedometers in the cows and bulls farmers are able to predict the best time for mating and to determine whether cattle has healthy living conditions,\u201d said Microsoft\u2019s Andaluz. \u201cFor instance, now we know that when cows are in heat, they walk longer distances at a faster pace. By analysing the data on the cow pedometer, it is now easier to find that unique moment for both the cow and the bull to be put next to each other to increase impregnation chances. This translates [to a] 50% increase of meat production as well as to the eliminate risk of disseminating diseases due to prompt diagnosis of diseases in the farm.\u201d Plus, you can find out how many cows pass the 10,000 step count goal.</p> <h2>The internet of bees</h2> <p>Agriculture is doomed without bees, and so are we. Without bees to pollinate, crops don\u2019t continue and we can\u2019t feed our connected cows.</p> <p>But <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/may/09/honeybees-dying-insecticide-harvard-study\">bees are in trouble</a>. Their numbers have been in sharp decline, and no one is entirely sure why. One explanation for colony collapse disorder (CCD), as the disaster is known, is a type of mite \u2013 and researchers at the University of Minnesota and a firm called Eltopia have a solution that pops the plague like popcorn while keeping bees and hives safe.</p> <p>Eltopia chief executive Will McHugh started his career on his family cherry farm, working with local bee keepers on tech even then to alter how the trees were pollinated. While working on that project, the keepers mentioned a mite that was attacking their bees. Those mites can be killed by heat, which doesn\u2019t bother the bees but does melt the wax that makes up their hives.</p> <p>So MacHugh and his fellow researchers developed a way to heat up specific spots in a hive from the inside, rather than heating the entire structure, using circuitry that\u2019s screen-printed on to a hive base, called the foundation.</p> <p>\u201cWe have printed circuitry on PLA (corn-based) plastic film that is coated with beeswax and impressed with a honeycomb pattern upon which the worker bees can draw out the comb,\u201d said co-founder Aaron Seelye. \u201cThe ink is a special type that can both act as a temperature sensor one moment, and a heater the next. By taking cues from the environment, we can interrupt the reproductive cycle of the Varroa Mite, which is widely considered the leading cause of CCD.\u201d</p> <p>There are points when the mites can be interrupted by temperature changes. When worker bees see that viable larvae are in a spot in the honeycomb, they top it with a wax cap to protect the offspring. That means the temperature stabilises \u2013 and when that happens, Eltopia\u2019s MiteNot tech kicks into gear.</p> <p>\u201cWhat our electronics do is two things: they monitor temperature and they produce heat,\u201d he said. When the temperature stabilises, sensors spot it, and the electronics automatically start generating heat, killing the mites without harming the bees. \u201cIf you heat the mites up to 107 degrees or 108 degrees, all the mites die,\u201d MacHugh said. \u201cThe bees actually kind of like it. The mites, because they\u2019re so much smaller, it almost pops them like popcorn.\u201d</p> <p>Alongside killing off the troublesome mites, the system also collects other data. \u201cIn conjunction with this application, we\u2019re working on things such as audio sensors, temperature and humidity, and durable scale, to tell honey gain [or] loss in a given timeframe),\u201d added Seelye.</p> <p>MacHugh pointed out that it\u2019s \u201ctoo early in the game\u201d to say if Eltopia\u2019s MiteNot is solving the CCD problem, as the technology has only been rolled out in the last month or so, and it\u2019s not clear whether mites are entirely to blame for the mass deaths of bees. \u201cRemoving [or] reducing the mites as a parasitic influence on the colony can only serve to do good for the overall health of our bee colonies, which are a critical component of our food supply,\u201d added Seelye.</p> <p>But Eltopia\u2019s technology could be a first step in changing how we keep pests off the plants we intend to eat. MacHugh pointed out that much of the discussion around food supply centres on pesticides. </p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a real battle in agriculture \u2013 over organic v inorganic, pesticides v GMO, etc,\u201d he said. \u201cI would just say that we\u2019re really focused on not giving in to those arguments and coming up with a solution that\u2019s sustainable.\u201d He stressed he has nothing against pesticides \u2013 they were engineered for reason \u2013 but it\u2019s understandable that some people don\u2019t want their food covered in chemicals, either. \u201cAnd it turns out we may not need them.\u201d</p>", "wordcount": "1804"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "environment/2017/mar/24/pigs-teeth-hippo-poo-behind-scenes-london-zoo", "type": "article", "sectionId": "environment", "sectionName": "Environment", "webPublicationDate": "2017-03-24T11:30:31Z", "webTitle": "Pigs' teeth and hippo poo: behind the scenes at London zoo", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/24/pigs-teeth-hippo-poo-behind-scenes-london-zoo", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/mar/24/pigs-teeth-hippo-poo-behind-scenes-london-zoo", "fields": {"byline": "Linda Nylind and Matt Fidler", "body": "<p>London zoo was established in 1828 and is the world\u2019s oldest scientific zoo.

They enjoy being given a shower by keeper Martin Franklin.</p> <p>He says: \u201cWe\u2019ve done three main things today. First we finched the animals. In the Galapagos Islands, where these guys are related to, they have a symbiotic relationship with the birds that live there, the Darwin\u2019s finches. The birds will land on the tortoises\u2019 shells and start picking away at the parasites and dead skin, so the birds get a free feed and the tortoises get a free clean. To facilitate that the tortoises will stretch out to expose as much of their body surface as they can. Today, when I started stroking the tortoises\u2019 legs the animals stretched out as much as they possibly could and effectively entered a trance for a good five or 10 minutes and allowed me to continue stroking them until they\u2019d had enough. The response is a perfectly natural behaviour, we haven\u2019t trained that at all, that\u2019s just them behaving according to their instinct when stimulated in the way they were. It can also be very useful for some veterinary procedures.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a5fa704502a6113d016e80ef613ffa1a8f680053\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5fa704502a6113d016e80ef613ffa1a8f680053/0_0_7007_4770/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Martin Franklin target training with the tortoises\" width=\"1000\" height=\"681\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Martin Franklin target training with the tortoises.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cOne of the other things we did today was a little bit of target training. We have trained them to respond to the colour red \u2013 they know that when a red ball is presented to them, if they follow that ball they will get a reward. That reward may be a particularly valuable piece of food or today it was just actually giving them a finching. We like to mix it up that way so they don\u2019t always get a food reward.</p> <p>\u201cThe advantage of that is manifold. Firstly these guys are quite heavy, these particular tortoises are a little bit heavier than me and they can reach up to about 250kg, so there\u2019s no way we can shift them if they don\u2019t want to be shifted. We have trained them effectively so we can move them where we want. That\u2019s helpful for example when we want to get them in at night or need to weigh them, which we do once a month to make sure they\u2019re healthy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cd7726d1f9f84fbf79b9ca1743cc5c38a43acf21\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd7726d1f9f84fbf79b9ca1743cc5c38a43acf21/1116_86_5878_4675/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Galapagos tortoises enjoy a shower\" width=\"1000\" height=\"795\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Galapagos tortoises enjoy a shower.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"370918bbb11bc68edd29b31a4703391531ca24b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/370918bbb11bc68edd29b31a4703391531ca24b7/419_0_6176_4912/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A tortoise savours the moment\" width=\"1000\" height=\"795\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A tortoise savours the moment.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li>The Galapagos tortoises enjoying their shower<br></li> </ul> <p>\u201cThe third thing we did was we gave them a little shower.

They enjoy being given a shower by keeper Martin Franklin.</p> <p>He says: \u201cWe\u2019ve done three main things today. First we finched the animals. In the Galapagos Islands, where these guys are related to, they have a symbiotic relationship with the birds that live there, the Darwin\u2019s finches. The birds will land on the tortoises\u2019 shells and start picking away at the parasites and dead skin, so the birds get a free feed and the tortoises get a free clean. To facilitate that the tortoises will stretch out to expose as much of their body surface as they can. Today, when I started stroking the tortoises\u2019 legs the animals stretched out as much as they possibly could and effectively entered a trance for a good five or 10 minutes and allowed me to continue stroking them until they\u2019d had enough. The response is a perfectly natural behaviour, we haven\u2019t trained that at all, that\u2019s just them behaving according to their instinct when stimulated in the way they were. It can also be very useful for some veterinary procedures.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a5fa704502a6113d016e80ef613ffa1a8f680053\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5fa704502a6113d016e80ef613ffa1a8f680053/0_0_7007_4770/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Martin Franklin target training with the tortoises\" width=\"1000\" height=\"681\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Martin Franklin target training with the tortoises.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cOne of the other things we did today was a little bit of target training. We have trained them to respond to the colour red \u2013 they know that when a red ball is presented to them, if they follow that ball they will get a reward. That reward may be a particularly valuable piece of food or today it was just actually giving them a finching. We like to mix it up that way so they don\u2019t always get a food reward.</p> <p>\u201cThe advantage of that is manifold. Firstly these guys are quite heavy, these particular tortoises are a little bit heavier than me and they can reach up to about 250kg, so there\u2019s no way we can shift them if they don\u2019t want to be shifted. We have trained them effectively so we can move them where we want. That\u2019s helpful for example when we want to get them in at night or need to weigh them, which we do once a month to make sure they\u2019re healthy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cd7726d1f9f84fbf79b9ca1743cc5c38a43acf21\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd7726d1f9f84fbf79b9ca1743cc5c38a43acf21/1116_86_5878_4675/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Galapagos tortoises enjoy a shower\" width=\"1000\" height=\"795\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Galapagos tortoises enjoy a shower.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"370918bbb11bc68edd29b31a4703391531ca24b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/370918bbb11bc68edd29b31a4703391531ca24b7/419_0_6176_4912/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A tortoise savours the moment\" width=\"1000\" height=\"795\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A tortoise savours the moment.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li>The Galapagos tortoises enjoying their shower<br></li> </ul> <p>\u201cThe third thing we did was we gave them a little shower.

Now its survival is being questioned by scientists puzzling over the precise cause for sharp declines that correlate with a rapidly changing climate. Colonies of this little penguin on the West Antarctic Peninsula have declined by at least 80% since the 1970s, and this is an area with more years of warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures than other regions.</p> <p>Changes in sea temperature and sea ice affects the availability of food, and where fish populations have fallen the penguins eat more krill, which is less nutritious. Nest sites may not be ideal if warming is creating premature melt and puddles on the ground as eggs cannot survive if they are lying in a pool of water. Most importantly, the Ad\u00e9ie penguin cannot survive without sea ice.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://climate.nasa.gov/news/2462/climate-change-may-shrink-adelie-penguin-range-by-end-of-century/\">paper published last year</a>, researchers predicted that 60% of the present habitat would be unsuitable for the penguins by 2099.

I was at Wembley that unforgettable day, aged 12, with my father and brother, dizzy with disbelief.</p> <p>Little did we know, though, that 1967 was just the beginning for hitherto humble Rangers. Within 10 years the club came within 14 minutes (during which Liverpool put three past Wolves, in a deciding game) of the First Division title, equivalent to today\u2019s Premier League. But memory of the zenith decade casts a shadow over QPR\u2019s half-centennial, for that achievement in 1975-76 was synonymous with the uncanny brilliance and waggish personality of one player: Bowles.

This wayward, wondrous, magical, yet totally down-to-earth street genius is the embodiment of our Queens Park Rangers.\u201d The composer Michael Nyman says: \u201cMy love of Stan goes back to a muddy match when he first played at Loftus Road against Rangers for Carlisle in 1972 [we signed him five months later].

Bowles reputedly took every opportunity during a game at Anfield to remind Souness of his mate\u2019s conquest. \u201cStan played football without stress or pressure,\u201d Shanks recalls. \u201cWhile other players would be in a panic during a big game, or poor shape for a bad one, Stan would just play. \u2018Give me the ball, I\u2019ll do the rest.\u2019 A football pitch was Stan\u2019s natural home.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Stan can hardly remember who he is.

If QPR were up in Manchester, he might stay over and play for a Sunday league team.\u201d Bowles would stop over at Shanks\u2019s parents\u2019 flat on the White City estate, next to Loftus Road: \u201cAlways polite \u2013 \u2018Thank you Mr Shanks, thank you Mrs Shanks\u2019 \u2026 I used to say: \u2018It\u2019s OK Stan \u2013 no one else talks to them like that.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>I remember Bowles joining fans in The Crown &amp; Sceptre near QPR\u2019s ground on Christmas Eve \u2013 his birthday. He was offered more pints than even he could manage, and bought a few himself, for total \u2013 albeit adoring \u2013 strangers.</p> <p>Most famously: \u201cStan loved a bet,\u201d says Shanks, who was also his partner at the White City dog track or bookmakers. \u201cNot big money \u2013 it was a pastime, 50 quid between two dogs, for the adrenaline rush. He hardly went to a casino, but if he did, he\u2019d put \u00a320 here, \u00a320 there. Later, he\u2019d go to those card schools and play for six hours.\u201d A barman at the dog track was John O\u2019Mahony, now among fans campaigning for a Bowles testimonial. He says: \u201cStan always drew people round him, but he never showed off. He was always just himself.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6ce11e5c1f03844e430d22df719fdc79cf4bca09\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ce11e5c1f03844e430d22df719fdc79cf4bca09/595_391_3055_1833/1000.jpg\" alt=\"England\u2019s Stan Bowles\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">England\u2019s Stan Bowles celebrates with Kevin Keegan after scoring against Wales in 1974.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colorsport/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And he still is, but actually not. Bowles moved back from London to Manchester before the family announced his condition in 2015. And here he is, at the Whitegate Inn on the road to Oldham, enjoying lager-and-lemonade-top with Andria, his friend Mike, a builder who visits every day, and Joanne Connolly, a fan whose dad \u2013 \u201cTaxi Teddy\u201d \u2013 knew Bowles from outings to the dogs; Joanne calls Stan the \u201cadolescent fervour that lasted a lifetime\u201d.</p> <p>Stan wears a dapper woollen overcoat, tartan tweed hat and smart scarf. Now he puts on a pair of sunglasses. \u201cDino!\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s Robert De Niro,\u201d explains Mike. \u201cDino!\u201d repeats Stan. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to speak Stan-ish,\u201d says Andria. \u201cHe\u2019s having a good day today, but it\u2019s not always like this. On bad days, he\u2019s a rabbit in the headlights, very anxious and confused.\u201d Andria, the modern-day matriarch of Moston, is a woman of humbling strength and commitment, but insists to the contrary: \u201cIt\u2019s something I do,\u201d she says of her charge. She admits: \u201cHe was a selfish dad, but he\u2019s mellowed, he\u2019d started to do that before the disease. Now he\u2019s home, with us, where my own nan and grandpa lived.\u201d</p> <p>There are moments of sudden clarity from Bowles. I mention Gerry Francis, the QPR captain with whom Stan had a telepathic rapport: \u201cGerry, he\u2019s alright he is.\u201d And when you call him Stan he corrects you: \u201cIt\u2019s Stanley!\u201d</p> <p>In comes Stanley\u2019s great-granddaughter, Macie, aged five. Andria used to run another pub down the road \u201cwhere my nan used to drink\u201d, but gave it up to look after Macie (\u201cmy son\u2019s daughter, but \u2026\u201d) before Stanley was diagnosed. \u201cSo it\u2019s like having two children now,\u201d says Andria. I ask: \u201cMacie, does he do what he\u2019s told?\u201d \u201cNo, \u2019cause he doesn\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying. He can\u2019t talk proper because he\u2019s poorly.

Mike takes him \u201cup\u201d to the smoke occasionally, and they stay around Brentford, Bowles\u2019s last professional club. Mention of the Bees starts another, urgent, conversation: that club staged a benefit game in 1987, and this season published a commemorative programme to raise funds for Stan\u2019s welfare. \u201cI see myself looking after him for the rest of his life,\u201d Andria insists, but talk inevitably turns to the possibility that Stan will need residential care one day. \u201cThere are two options,\u201d Shanks had said, \u201cgo the NHS way or get private so he can be comfortable and his family can visit.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a place down the road,\u201d says Andria, \u201c\u00a3600 a week.\u201d</p> <p>Bowles played in days when footballers even at his level were unable to plan for what might follow. The announcement that Billy McNeill \u2013 the first captain of a British team, Celtic, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/may/21/lisbon-lions-celtic-internazionale\">to hoist the European Cup</a>, half a century ago \u2013 suffers from dementia reopened the dual debates over welfare <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/feb/15/footballers-could-be-at-risk-of-dementia-from-blows-to-the-head-study-suggests\">and head injuries</a>. Bowles\u2019s condition \u2013 and dire financial straits \u2013 is an example of the game\u2019s reluctance to look after its own; Nobby Stiles also suffers from Alzheimer\u2019s, but there is scant care from mighty Manchester United. Alex Young, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/feb/27/alex-young-everton-hearts-scotland-dies-aged-80\">who died last week from a short illness after suffering from dementia</a>, had better luck having played for Everton who operate, says O\u2019Mahony, \u201ca role-model system for former players\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"daa1d91732cb38fb5aa2513b0a6958fa2ab28ff2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/daa1d91732cb38fb5aa2513b0a6958fa2ab28ff2/0_98_3772_2263/1000.jpg\" alt=\"QPR\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stan Bowles, left, with Gerry Francis, Frank McLintock and manager Dave Sexton after QPR beat Leeds 2-0 in May 1976 amid a thrilling title run-in.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reg Lancaster/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>QPR has an ex-players association, but with no benevolent welfare charge. \u201cSometimes,\u201d says Shanks, \u201cI wonder what the PFA is there for if not to help people like Stan and Frank Sibley [Rangers midfielder in that 1967 Wembley final, now battling Parkinson\u2019s]. I also wonder if the people running QPR understand the legacy, who Stan was, what he meant to the club and its fans.\u201d</p> <p>The club did organise a Stan Bowles Day in 2015, at which he waved to adoring crowds before a game with Rotherham. Fifty pence from each programme went to Bowles, and <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/StanBowles\">there\u2019s a fund with over \u00a315,000 in it</a> \u2013 but the matter of a proper testimonial at QPR has embittered some corners of Shepherd\u2019s Bush. Discussions began in 2015, when supporters met the club soon after Bowles\u2019s family made his condition public. \u201cThe first meeting was positive,\u201d says O\u2019Mahony, \u201cbut it was down to us to arrange it all, and raise funds. Now we\u2019re two years down the line, and Stan has deteriorated.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for the club referred to a statement a fortnight ago from the chief executive, Lee Hoos, who said: \u201cTo set the record straight: QPR, as a club, welcome the proposal of a Stan Bowles benefit match. We are determined to help put on an event for Stan that supports his care and raises money \u2026 We are today starting the steps to ensure this event is a success.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no coming back from where Stan is now,\u201d says Shanks. \u201cBut \u2026\u201d He recalls Stan Bowles Day \u2013 \u201cwhen Stan walked out at Loftus Road he knew exactly where he was, for some reason; a moment of knowing who he was.

It wasn\u2019t just a literary inspiration. Deep down it fuelled my own compulsion to train a goshawk after my father\u2019s sudden death. When I read it as a child I understood that it was about a man running to a hawk to escape from something. Back then I didn\u2019t know anything about White\u2019s violent, loveless childhood, nor his struggles with his sexuality. I didn\u2019t know why he was running. But I knew he was hurting. And when my father died and I was hurting too, some part of me remembered that a goshawk was something to run away to.</p> <p>You don\u2019t have to unconditionally love a book for it to inspire you. <em>The Goshawk</em> is a painful read, and I still find White\u2019s relationship with his hawk very difficult to bear. But it helped me to think more clearly about how we unconsciously use nature as a mirror of ourselves, and how suffering is so often brought about not through evil, but through carelessness and ignorance. Despite his capacity for great joy and love for many things, including the natural world, White was never given the tools to know how to properly love or care for things, including himself.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"774b3c346ad7032fa785b6615b57d999d81d32a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/774b3c346ad7032fa785b6615b57d999d81d32a2/0_441_2060_1235/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Helen Macdonald\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Helen Macdonald.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Si Barber</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His confiding authorial voice is in large part what also makes <em>The Goshawk</em> a magnificent read, and it was this that motivated me to move away from the objective, authoritative tone of much writing about nature to try to write a book that was more reflexive, made up of voices that were not always full of certainty, that were sometimes contradictory, not always obviously my own. Because, ultimately, White\u2019s honesty about his relationship to the English landscape and his hawk, however distressing and often self-deceiving, was the book\u2019s greatest inspiration to me. Laying bare the grounds of our emotional attachments to the natural world \u2013 or our lack of them \u2013 is of crucial importance in our age of ecological disaster. <em>The Goshawk</em> is a touchstone in this regard: a work that spurs one to think deeply about why and how we assign value to things that are not us.</p> <p><em>Helen Macdonald is the author of </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/h-is-for-hawk.html/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">H Is for Hawk</a><em> (Vintage Classics).</em></p> <h2><strong>Robert Macfarlane</strong><br><strong><em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/road-5.html/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">The Road</a> </em></strong>by Cormac McCarthy<strong> (2006)</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d520156abcbad2a4731b0fd0ebec439782f9bec3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d520156abcbad2a4731b0fd0ebec439782f9bec3/0_229_5554_3332/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Macfarlane walks along ancient pathways in the Chilterns.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robert Macfarlane walks along ancient pathways in the Chilterns.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Hall/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/apr/30/britain-wild-places-vital-our-imaginations\">Britain's wild places are vital to our imaginations</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There isn\u2019t much of what you might call nature left in Cormac McCarthy\u2019s best-known novel. There isn\u2019t much of anything, really: just asphalt, ash, shattered buildings and the inevitable, indestructible shopping trolley. Organic life has all but vanished. Even the colour green has gone extinct. Language is burnt back to a rubble of grunts and fillers: uh-uh, OK, yeah. This is \u201cnature writing\u201d at its asymptote, with only the act of utterance keeping it from pure black zero.</p> <p>McCarthy might seem a cussed choice, then, as the most inspirational writer of place that I know. But there it is. His bleakness is bracing. And his earlier novels are ornate where <em>The Road</em> is minimalist. I\u2019ve read them all several times (except <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/suttree.html\"><em>Suttree</em></a>, which beats me still). For years I kept a notebook titled \u201cCM\u201d into which I copied phrases and paragraphs from his novels: \u201cAll night sheetlightning quaked sourceless to the west beyond the midnight thunderheads, making a bluish day of the distant desert.\u201d I watched what he did with commas, or their absence: \u201cAs they went down the valley in the new fell dark basking nighthawks rose from the dust in the road before them with wild wings and eyes red as jewels in the headlights.\u201d I admired his treatment of poverty and labour, and how he scourged sentimentalism but refused to banish beauty: \u201cThis country will kill you in a heartbeat and still people love it.\u201d</p> <p>McCarthy\u2019s novels are filled with watchers and hunters, from the Indian scouts of <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/blood-meridian.html\"><em>Blood Meridian</em></a> through the wolf-trackers of <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/border-trilogy-2.html\">the Border Trilogy</a>, to the father in <em>The Road</em>, \u201cglassing\u201d the terrain ahead of him with binoculars, knowing that under such circumstances foresight is fate. His characters read landscapes intently, because their life or the life of another often depends on that scrutiny. They excel in hard, sharp sentences of seeing.</p> <p>But his characters also channel thoughts and visions that far exceed their terms of perception. McCarthy carries out audacious acts of cantilever, extending his sentences with clause after clause until they are cranked out over nothingness: \u201cToward early morning he woke, sat up quickly and looked about him. It was still dark and the fire had long since died, still dark and quiet with that silence that seems to be of itself listening, an astral quiet where planets collide soundlessly, beyond the auricular dimension altogether.\u201d Such passages are written with a pen of iron dipped in Old Testament ink, and they trace out a cosmic baroque. They are not to everyone\u2019s taste, but they are to mine.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>\u2018He shows us that writing about \u201cnature\u201d can help us see the shadows as well as the light\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>McCarthy\u2019s great subjects are the brute indifference of matter and the brute indifference of people: \u201cI\u2019ve seen the meanness of humans till I don\u2019t know why god ain\u2019t put out the sun and gone away.\u201d He shows us that writing about \u201cnature\u201d \u2013 whatever on earth we mean by that word \u2013 can help us see the shadows as well as the light.</p> <p><em>Robert Macfarlane\u2019s most recent book </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/landmarks-265227.html/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">Landmarks</a><em> is out in paperback from Penguin next week.</em></p> <h2><strong>Mark Cocker</strong><br><strong><em>The Journal, 1837-1861</em> by Henry David Thoreau</strong><br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a653c1b14596e04b6e951c4b71061aaca41ac66\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a653c1b14596e04b6e951c4b71061aaca41ac66/0_0_5130_3414/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bracket fungi on a tree at Lydford Gorge, Devon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thoreau write that a \u2018truly good book is something as wildly natural and primitive \u2026 as a fungus or a lichen\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Millar/NTPL</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is the largest single-volume edition of the diary that Thoreau kept for nearly a quarter of a century until the year before his death in 1862, aged just 44.

With the exception of field guides that I use outdoors, <em>The Journal</em> is the only book that I have laminated to protect it from constant wear, and I see it as a kind of field guide for life.</p> <p>Its inspiration is to both the naturalist and the author, occupations that are integrally linked through Thoreau\u2019s astonishing powers of observation. He could stand so still that animals would mistake him for a part of the landscape, climbing upon him to feed or perch. Eyewitnesses in his native Concord described how they would find him, Socrates-like, completely absorbed in some act of contemplation. At the end of day he would be in exactly the same place as when first spotted, and still watching.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>\u2018It is the only book that I have laminated to protect it from constant wear\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Thoreau recognised the deep links between this quality of seeing and his art. In an 1852 entry he describes how he had two notebooks, one for poetry and another for commonplace facts, but he acknowledged the difficulty in keeping them separate, because \u201cthe most interesting and beautiful facts are so much the more poetry\u201d.</p> <p>He was equally alive to the manner in which physical engagement with the natural world (work, walking, exertion etc) had a direct impact on one\u2019s prose. \u201cI find incessant labour with the hands, which engrosses the attention also, the best method to remove palaver out of one\u2019s style,\u201d he wrote. Instead of palaver, what you get in Thoreau is always robust, precise and fundamentally true. In our age when the substance of nature writing has often been supplanted by style, <em>The Journal</em> seems all the more important.</p> <p>Although it is pre-eminently about Thoreau\u2019s observations of wild nature, for me this New England diary is also a powerfully political work. And it means much \u2013 more even, perhaps? \u2013 to someone from the Old World, where land is almost never land, but property. The Old English see place and the living animals and plants upon it through a dense layer of other processes that are about ownership, control, class, money. They impose a deadening gauze over our senses and our sense of place like a cataract over the eye. Thoreau writes not about ownership, but about belonging. To read him is to be liberated from all that stuff and to recover the republican and democratic greatness of our connection to the whole of life.</p> <p><em>Mark Cocker is the author of </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/crow-country.html/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">Crow Country</a><em> (Vintage Classics).</em></p> <h2><strong>Stephen Moss</strong><br><strong><em>Adventure Lit Their Star</em> by Kenneth Allsop (1949)</strong><br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ceda10f3334ac1fbdbcabeae05c9fd173869c98a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ceda10f3334ac1fbdbcabeae05c9fd173869c98a/0_194_5142_3086/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ringed plover\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The heroes of Allsop\u2019s novel were two ringed plovers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not many novels have a bird \u2013 or in the case of <em>Adventure Lit Their Star</em>, a pair of birds \u2013 as their hero. Little ringed plovers are small, slender waders with a black face-mask and conspicuous yellow eye-ring. At first sight they may not seem very special. But for me they are, as they were for the nature writer Kenneth Allsop.</p> <p>Little ringed plovers colonised Britain either side of the second world war. But they didn\u2019t nest on some remote mountain or offshore island, or under the protection of a nature reserve. Instead, they chose what Allsop memorably dubbed \u201cthe messy limbo that is neither town nor country\u201d \u2013 the west London suburbs where I grew up.</p> <p>Allsop, who later found fame as a campaigning Fleet Street journalist and face of TV current affairs, wrote <em>Adventure Lit Their Star</em> when he was a cub reporter in the late 1940s. Not surprisingly, given his own wartime experiences, the story revolves around a young RAF pilot recovering from TB. He joins forces with two young lads to foil the attentions of a dastardly egg-collector, who is intent on stealing the eggs of these very rare birds.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>\u2018The opening chapter is a tour de force of nature writing, rarely matched before or since\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The book was published in 1949, but after good reviews and a literary prize for its author it was soon forgotten. I stumbled across it as a teenager in the early 1970s, and was instantly captivated. The opening chapter is a tour de force of nature writing, rarely matched before or since. Allsop traces the night-time flight made by hordes of migrating birds as they cross the Channel, on the last leg of their epic journey back to Britain from Africa. In a brilliant and original twist, he imagines them as squadrons of aeroplanes returning home from a nocturnal sortie.</p> <p>Soon after reading the book, I found my own little ringed plovers, in the vast concrete amphitheatre of a reservoir being built a stone\u2019s throw from where the novel is set, on the outskirts of London. As I watched these birds flying around the digging machines \u2013 they nest on bare gravel, so that their eggs and chicks are camouflaged against predators \u2013 I could really appreciate the way Allsop described their behaviour. This was a man who spent time watching wild creatures, and understood what made them tick.</p> <p>Later, I read his collected Daily Mail columns, <em>In the Country</em>. The book was so full of wisdom and insight that I forced myself to read it as slowly as possible, so as not to reach the end. Another reason I was reluctant to finish was that I knew that, soon after the book was published, the author took his own life. He was just 53 \u2013 younger than I am now.</p> <p>Yet I cannot be too sad when I think of Allsop; for his wonderful writings have inspired not just me, but a host of other nature writers and environmentalists. He makes us want to continue fighting for the wildlife and places he cared for so much, and about which he wrote with such effortless charm.</p> <p><em>Stephen Moss\u2019s latest book, </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/385179/s/wild-kingdom//?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">Wild Kingdom: Bringing Back Britain\u2019s Wildlife</a><em>, is out now (Square Peg).</em></p> <h2><strong>Tim Dee</strong><br><strong><em>The Redstart</em> by John Buxton (1950)</strong><br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7b8a54553020d1352008712157b9bf60ec53ba24\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b8a54553020d1352008712157b9bf60ec53ba24/0_177_5104_3062/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Common redstart\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Common redstart, or <em>Phoenicurus phoenicurus</em>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The common redstart is the most beautiful bird I know. Not every birdwatcher would agree, but surely none think badly of this bright-painted little chat. They are always good to see. Males (in spring, this very day across Britain) have ash-grey backs, brick-red fronts, soot-black throats and, above their friendly round faces (their eyes are like living blackcurrants), a pearl-coloured fringe that floodlights the whole bird. Females are drabber, having work to do beyond looking dreamy, but they share the redstart\u2019s best and defining feature with their mates. They cannot see it themselves but both carry behind them a warm red tail. Every second, as if counting time, they tremble or quiver or flirt these feathers and they pulse with various toasted orangey-reds.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>\u2018For the most beautiful bird, the most beautiful bird book\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/john-clare\">John Clare,</a> best of all bird poets, knew redstarts as firetails. Their tail also lends the bird its common name. In Middle English <em>stert</em> means tail. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/13/wikipedia-influence-list-carl-linnaeus\">Linnaeus</a> and later taxonomists were bewitched by the same and alighted on <em>Phoenicurus phoenicurus</em> for the bird\u2019s scientific name, meaning red-tail red-tail, as if its mobile brilliance summoned both observation and appreciation. Add to this, the salve of the bird\u2019s silverily song that sounds (to me) like a glance of sunshine on a rainy path, and their migratory lifestyle that takes them from among the dusty feet of dung-coloured camels in the Sahel of central Africa (where I saw them last winter) to the salad-fresh oak woods of the hanging combes of western Britain (where, on Exmoor, I saw them last week); and I hope I might find some followers for my best bird.</p> <p>For the most beautiful bird, the most beautiful bird book I know. Its author is dead, it is long out of print, its science is superseded by more recent ornithological studies, but John Buxton\u2019s <em>The Redstart</em> from 1950, a slim and sketchy New Naturalist monograph, has ignited most of my bird bonfires since I read it in Bristol Central Library as a neophyte birder fresh in from a fleeting encounter with a migrant firetail. Buxton\u2019s book taught me a lot about how the birds live and what they do. It also showed me a way to think about birds and a way to write about them. Captured by the Germans early in the second world war, Buxton was an amateur bird man, a poet and a literature don. He started watching a pair of redstarts that flew through the wire to breed in the grounds of the Bavarian camp in which he was held prisoner. He ended up recruiting other captives as co-observers, securing paper and pencils from his captors, and watching the two birds for 850 hours over three months in the spring of 1943. His book is written with a clear-eyed understanding born of these efforts but it is also something altogether other. The birds\u2019 modest but assertive commitment to their own purpose, and their free flights through the wire, oblivious to the \u201cskeletal multitude\u201d of men, operated on Buxton such that he wrote, undercover as an ornithologist, a book about the limits of knowing and the value of this, and the impossibility of total capture, and the great boon of loving a bird beyond the pages we might write about it or the names we might call it.</p> <p><em>Tim Dee is the author of </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/385257//?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">The Running Sky</a> <em>and</em> <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/four-fields.html/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">Four Fields</a><em>. </em></p> <h2><strong>Melissa Harrison</strong><br><strong><em>A Black Fox Running</em> by Brian Carter (1981)</strong><br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4a847ad625567b587648a6cabd428e1b4783a239\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a847ad625567b587648a6cabd428e1b4783a239/0_0_5100_3391/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dartmoor National Park\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carter\u2019s \u2018vision of Dartmoor as a complex living ecosystem is extraordinary\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This book by the Devon author, artist and columnist Brian Carter probably had a greater influence on my development as a writer than any other. It was published in 1981 and I read it \u2013 or rather, it was read to me \u2013 in 1982, when I was seven. I must have reread it a dozen times or more since then. Eventually the pages fell out of my paperback so I tracked down a first-edition hardback, which, rather pleasingly, arrived signed.</p> <p>My mum had a beautiful reading voice, and every night before bed she led us through <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/jrrtolkien\">Tolkien</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jul/25/allison-uttley-travellerin-time-mangan\">Alison Uttley</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/laurie-lee\">Laurie Lee</a>, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/lark-rise-to-candleford-2.html\"><em>Lark Rise to Candleford</em></a>, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/apr/12/miss-read\">Miss Read books</a> and many others; but it was the Devon writers, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/15/henry-williamson-power-nature\">Henry Williamson</a> and Carter, who had the greatest effect on me. We spent our summer holidays on Dartmoor, so these were places I knew intimately, and loved; to hear them given such luminosity and significance left me longing to do the same one day.</p> <p>There\u2019s no getting away from the fact that <em>A Black Fox Running</em> is about talking foxes. New readers should know, too, that these foxes approve of fox-hunting: it is, to them, \u201cthe good death\u201d (snares, spades, gas and gins being other options). It is also quite mystical: one fox has visions, there is a benevolent vulpine deity, and some passages are steeped in the kind of fuzzy, pantheistic spirituality that would usually make me wince.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>\u2018New readers should know, too, that these foxes approve of fox-hunting\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And yet it rises effortlessly above these potential hazards; the quality of the writing and the depth and clarity of Carter\u2019s imagination turning it into something almost inexpressibly beautiful. His vision of Dartmoor as a complex living ecosystem is extraordinary; he seems to be able to hold everything in his mind at once, from a fox kennelled under bracken in the lee of a dry-stone wall, to an old poacher rumpling the ears of his half-mad dog, to a feather lost by a buzzard drifting down to dimple the surface of a stream \u2013 all of it, human and non-human, happening at once and with equal significance. His prose slips subtly from lyrical description to earthy humour, its rhythms sunk deep into my DNA as something to aim for, if never achieve.</p> <p>Carter died last year, having contributed to every edition of West Country newspaper the Herald Express since the early 1980s. Long before I ever put pen to paper, even in secret, I wrote to him care of his publisher; I hope it reached him, although he didn\u2019t reply.

This is a problem nature writers, as writers, must grapple with. Nature writing matters, but by definition can\u2019t be great literature.

Dillard\u2019s collection <em>Teaching a Stone to Talk</em> was a revelation. \u201cLiving as Weasels\u201d is a flight of only 1,500 words. The horrifying \u201cThe Deer at Providentia\u201d not much more. \u201cEclipse\u201d is genius, again a few thousand words. That\u2019s how \u201cnature\u201d is encountered by most of us, who can\u2019t spend a year crawling in bushes, who have to get home of a night to make the kids\u2019 fish fingers. Short encounter, short form. The UK seemed to have abandoned it, but the essay was alive and well in the US.</p> <p>Seriously liberating was Dillard\u2019s note: \u201cThis is not a collection of occasional pieces, such as a writer brings out to supplement his real work; instead this is my real work, such as it is.\u201d</p> <p>So there was the solution, and it was to do with form not content.

Beuys founded his Political Party for Animals, stood for the German Green party and planted 7,000 oak trees across the city of Kassel.

Insulated from the world at large, concentrated into the flight range of a colony of bees, my notes for my book <em>Bee Journal</em> accumulated as a counterspirit to everything I read of gaiacide: nature as the site of crisis. By containing his encounter with America to time spent with a coyote, Beuys insulated himself in an acutely observed dialogue.</p> <p>The coyote performance and Steiner\u2019s lectures inform my own questions around art practice and the environment. \u201cYou should not believe for even a moment that whatever exists somewhere in nature is without certain powers,\u201d Steiner reflected.

It describes an expedition to Africa to capture rare animals for zoos. I couldn\u2019t believe that anyone could make a living by doing something that was so exciting. I soon devoured it, and then all of his other books, but I was particularly captivated by his descriptions of his idyllic-sounding childhood on the island of Corfu in the 1930s in <em>My Family and Other Animals</em>. He describes his excursions in search of turtles, mantises, snakes and all manner of other exotic-sounding creatures, precursors to his zoo-collecting days. He even had a pet donkey that went with him everywhere, festooned in bundles of jam jars tied together with string to transport home his finds. The beasts he captured all ended up inhabiting his bedroom, loosely contained in a series of home-made cages and tanks, or escaping to wreak havoc on the nerves of his long-suffering mother.</p> <p>I tried to model my own life on his childhood adventures. I grew up in rural Shropshire where the wildlife was comparatively mundane. Despite my best efforts I could not persuade my parents to buy me a donkey so I had to settle for a bicycle, but otherwise I did my best to emulate Durrell. My bedroom was filled with fish tanks and home-made cages containing newts, caterpillars, sticklebacks and a toad named Norman. For a while I even had a pet magpie that followed me around.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>\u2018I couldn\u2019t believe that anyone could make a living by doing something that was so exciting\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When Durrell grew up he made his expeditions all over the world in search of elusive animals, and eventually set up his own zoo on Jersey to contain them. Obviously catching rare animals for zoos is no longer acceptable or desirable, so I had to modify my original plan of continuing in Durrell\u2019s footsteps. Instead, I have been lucky enough to make a living as a scientist, studying the ecology and behaviour of rare creatures in the wild, sometimes travelling around the world to find them. My speciality is bees rather than the larger beasts that Durrell captured; small but vitally important creatures that help to put food on our plates and do their best to ensure that the world is full of flowers. I focus on bumblebees, thecolourful, furry and endearingly clumsy relatives of the domestic honeybee.

They can be recognised by their four transparent wings, which bear a lace-like network of veins and which gives them their name. This group of insects has a long and worthy fossil record, starting back in the Permian period, 250 million years ago. Most people are familiar with the idea of insects trapped in amber (thank you, Jurassic Park), and fossils preserved in this way are often spectacular, but many insect fossils are preserved in a more conventional, and less glamorous, mode: compression fossils sandwiched between layers of fine-grained sedimentary rock. Kalligrammatid lacewings are an extinct group known exclusively from this type of preservation, from the Middle Jurassic (about 160 million years ago) until the Early Cretaceous (about 120 million years ago), and their fossils have been discovered from across the world.</p> <p>Kalligrammatid lacewings are interesting because they are a classic example of convergent evolution. They closely resemble butterflies (Lepidoptera), which do not appear in the fossil record until around 56 million years ago. Molecular studies suggest an earlier origin for butterflies, around 80 million years ago, but this still represents a clear 40 million year gap between the two insect groups. A recent paper by Conrad Labandeira and colleagues demonstrated that the convergence seen between kalligrammatid lacewings and modern butterflies was more than a superficial similarity. <br></p> <p>Details of kalligrammatid wing eyespots and their pigmentation, their wing scales, and their evolution of a long proboscis for siphoning nectar all bore close comparison with examples from the modern Lepidoptera. Both types of insect were making their living in a spookily similar way, despite enormous changes in the plant groups providing their habitat and diet during the Mesozoic Era.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2dad75fdafe57a1c05bf0e846b64a066bc8a6895\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2dad75fdafe57a1c05bf0e846b64a066bc8a6895/0_0_1728_3212/538.jpg\" alt=\"Comparison on the lacewing Oreogramma and a modern butterfly\" width=\"538\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Comparison on the lacewing <em>Oreogramma</em> and a modern butterfly</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Di Loreto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The flowering plants, or angiosperms, are the dominant plants on Earth today. They provide the vast majority of the plant-based food we eat (unless you are a really big fan of either pesto or nori). Farmers, scientists and policy-makers all worry a great deal about how they are pollinated, and the about the health of key insect pollinator populations, especially bees. The future of insect-pollinated angiosperms and their pollinators are inextricably linked because they have evolved together in tight evolutionary feedback loops (an example of coevolution). Butterflies evolved alongside the angiosperms, as they diversified into the 350, 000 flowering plant species we see today \u2013 but unequivocal angiosperm fossils (pollen and whole organs) are only known from around 130 million years ago onwards, too late for coevolution with the kalligrammatid lacewings. So what plants were the kalligrammatids coevolving with?</p> <p>If you look at the illustrations in children\u2019s dinosaur books, it won\u2019t take you too long to come across a plant in the background, looking something like a large, squat pineapple covered with flowers. These are bennettites, an extinct group of seed plants with a superficial similarity to cycads (another ancient, but surviving, group of seed plants). They have very different reproductive structures to cycads though, and these have been interpreted by many researchers as \u2018flower-like\u2019 in their organisation and complexity. <br></p> <p>Over the last century or so, the relationship between angiosperms, bennettites and other seed plants such as the gnetophytes (species including Ephedra) has been fiercely debated. Molecular sequence-based methods can only go some way to untangling their family tree, since the bennettites became extinct about 65 million years ago, and DNA that old has never been retrieved (thanks again, Jurassic Park). Whatever the relationship between early angiosperms and bennettites, in terms of ecology, bennettites are the likely suspects in any early partnerships between \u2018flower-like-organs\u2019 and insect pollinators.</p> <p>Close associations between bennettites and boring beetles (the sort who make holes, rather than the merely dull) have been described in Cycadeoidea, a type of bennettite in which the pollen-bearing \u2018flowers\u2019 appear to have remained embedded within the trunk of the plant throughout the life-cycle of the plant. Were tunnelling, pollen-eating beetles therefore essential to its pollination? Similarly, Labandeira and colleagues propose that the elaborate siphoning mouthparts of some kalligrammatid lacewings evolved to exactly complement another group of bennettites. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd8cf1ce13230db511df6c5c963fd66a828c018f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd8cf1ce13230db511df6c5c963fd66a828c018f/0_318_5242_3146/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A modern cycad - a distant relative of the bennettites\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A modern cycad - a distant relative of the bennettites</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Harvey/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Members of the Williamsoniaceae family bore their flower-like organs externally on stalks, rather than packed inside their trunk, and the long, sturdy mouthparts of some kalligrammatids would be ideally suited to probing their female flower-like organs for, presumably, nectar-like fluid. This reading of the fossil record suggests that plant-animal coevolution can result in staggeringly similar results from similar ecological interactions, even when the plant and animal groups involved are only distantly related, and separated by many millions of years.<br></p> <p>With coevolution comes mutual interdependence, right up to the bitter end. The sudden radiation of the angiosperms during the Cretaceous was matched by a sharp decline in previously dominant seed plant groups, including the bennettites. The kalligrammatid lacewings also drop out of the fossil record by the mid Cretaceous. We would do well to keep a very watchful eye on our modern crop-pollinating insect friends.</p> <p><a href=\"http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/283/1824/20152893\">Conrad C.

Artichoke suppers were a family tradition: we\u2019d eat them with beurre noir, dunking in the leaves, then the hearts, before mopping up the butter with bread. It&#xa0;was a brilliantly economical supper for my mother, who turned it&#xa0;into a ritual that we came to love.</p> <p>I now eat artichokes in as many ways as I can when they\u2019re in season. If you need just the hearts, as for today\u2019s recipes, boil them whole and&#xa0;have the leaves as a&#xa0;cook\u2019s perk,&#xa0;or as a starter; otherwise buy ready-prepared hearts in jars or tins.</p> <h2><strong>Artichoke heart and summer vegetable tempura with honey saffron mayonnaise</strong></h2> <p>There\u2019s no great secret to tempura batter: use a deep pan so you don\u2019t need as much oil, and get it up to heat before frying.

With the motor still running, now pour in the rest of the oil in a thin, steady stream, then add the saffron and its soaking liquid. Season, then stir in lemon juice to taste: you want a bright and lemony mayo that\u2019s not too acidic. If it\u2019s a bit on the thick side, loosen with a&#xa0;tablespoon of cold water.</p> <p>Cut the courgettes and aubergine into two-bite pieces and cut the artichoke hearts in half. Whisk the egg yolks for the batter with the fizzy water, then stir in both flours, but only just to combine: you want some lumps, because they\u2019ll help with the crispness. Add&#xa0;the vegetables and sage, if using.</p> <p>Fill a narrow, heavy-based pan with enough oil to come 5cm up the sides and heat to 180C (if you don\u2019t have a thermometer, that\u2019s the stage when a cube of bread browns and crisps within 30 seconds). Frying each different vegetable at a time, lift them out of the batter and fry in batches so as not to overcrowd the pan. Cook until crisp and pale gold all over, then transfer to a plate lined with kitchen paper and season with salt. Keep warm and repeat with the other veg. Serve hot with the mayo alongside. (Alternatively, fry everything in advance and reheat in a hot oven: the tempura won\u2019t be as light and crisp as it is straight from the fryer, but it\u2019ll still be very good.)</p> <h2><strong>Artichoke heart, pea and broad bean stew with soft polenta</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3a025e18991fa773d5d783ef1012838a5654c006\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a025e18991fa773d5d783ef1012838a5654c006/0_325_5320_3192/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thomasina Miers\u2019 artichoke heart, pea and broad bean stew with soft polenta.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomasina Miers\u2019 artichoke heart, pea and broad bean stew with soft polenta.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Louise Hagger for the Guardian.

This left them with small fragments of the plant that could then be bleached and their structure examined using powerful microscopes. <br></p> <p>The plant appears to have had no roots or petals. Its leaves were arranged in two forms: either in a spiral or opposite one another along an axis. The plant sprouted several tiny flowers, each of which contained a single seed. <br></p> <p>Animals in this time period hadn\u2019t developed any role in the dispersal of seeds, says Dilcher. Instead, the plant is thought to have separate male and female flowers. It seems likely that the seeds were released straight into the water, where they floated off to fertilise another plant. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6e6dff717b41c81b75e470ea7af4f89a74b752a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e6dff717b41c81b75e470ea7af4f89a74b752a0/0_0_413_578/357.jpg\" alt=\"To study the 130-million-year-old plant, researchers had to slowly dissolve the limestone surrounding the fossils.\" width=\"357\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">To study the 130-million-year-old plant, researchers had to slowly dissolve the limestone surrounding the fossils.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gomez et al/PNAS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThis is a fascinating and provocative analysis of the new fossils,\u201d says Sam Brockington, a research fellow in the department of plant sciences at Cambridge University. \u201cIt has always been difficult to say whether the first flowering plants emerged in aquatic conditions, but this paper emphasises how important aquatic environments were for the earliest flowering plants.\u201d <br></p> <p>Sometime in the middle of the Cretaceous period the diversification of the flowering plant population exploded, developing into the beautiful blooms we know today, as well as influencing the wildlife that evolved alongside. Dilcher says that we wouldn\u2019t be here at all if it weren\u2019t for plants like <em>Montsechia vidalii</em>. \u201cWe are a product of the many stages of evolution that went hand-in-hand with the evolution of flowering plants,\u201d he says. <br></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bernard_Gomez\">Bernard Gomez</a> of Claude Bernard University, Lyon, and co-author of the paper, which is <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1509241112\">published today in PNAS</a>, says that there may yet be an even older flowering plant. There\u2019s evidence of pollen dispersed in fossils that are around 140 million years old, he says. <br></p> <p>One thing is for sure, says Dilcher, \u201cwe need to understand as much as we can about flowering plant evolution because right now we\u2019re facing a world crisis.\u201d Most modern flowering plants need animal pollinators to reproduce, with bees serving that role for many of our most important crops. Yet bees are declining in the US and Europe. <br></p> <p>\u201cThis plant shows us where it all began,\u201d says Dilcher. \u201cIf we know more about their evolution, we might come across alternative pollinators that are hidden out of sight today but played a role in the past that we could encourage again.\u201d <br></p> <p></p>", "wordcount": "550"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "small-business-network/2016/jul/10/ebbs-and-flows-of-running-canal-boat-business", "type": "article", "sectionId": "small-business-network", "sectionName": "Guardian Small Business Network", "webPublicationDate": "2016-07-10T08:58:57Z", "webTitle": "The ebb and flow of running a canal boat business", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2016/jul/10/ebbs-and-flows-of-running-canal-boat-business", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/small-business-network/2016/jul/10/ebbs-and-flows-of-running-canal-boat-business", "fields": {"byline": "Louise Tickle", "body": "<p><br><strong><a href=\"http://www.thefloatingsalon.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Floating Salon Narrowboat</a>, located nationwide, is run by </strong><strong>Nicola Dawkins</strong></p> <p>The Floating Salon was a crazy idea I thought up to combine my love of the water and my love of hair styling.

I wanted a nomadic lifestyle and needed an income so selling herbs and spices, both culinary and botanical, seemed like a way of bringing everything I love together. Once I\u2019d decided to live on a boat, I realised I needed a business I could run while on the water and on the move; herbs and spices are quite light and compact and it was achievable within the very limited storage facilities available. That has actually become a positive, in that my stock base is small and regularly replaced so supplies are always fresh. I also sell herb plants, which live quite happily on my roof and always attract a lot of attention from passersby and bees. </p> <p>Rain is a problem for all market traders, but the sun is more of a problem for me as it causes rapid deterioration of my stock. Deliveries can be a challenge, but I am lucky to have a wide network of land-based friends who let me use their addresses, and local pubs and boatyards are always very accommodating. I post where I\u2019m trading on my website and Facebook pages and will sometimes put up posters in a town when I moor up.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.cafeonthecut.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cafe on the Cut</a>, based at </strong><strong>Gloucester Docks, is owned by Vanessa Radwell</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa486288cf09dda50d58da8f30099b84f36c2f5c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa486288cf09dda50d58da8f30099b84f36c2f5c/52_0_1520_912/1000.jpg\" alt=\"All food is served fresh on Cafe on the Cut\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">All food is served fresh on Cafe on the Cut.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My sister planted the seed of the idea to set up a narrowboat cafe. Never one to dodge a challenge, I sold my small boat \u2013 I\u2019ve lived on the water for 14 years \u2013 and got a 50-footer to live and work on. My family gutted her: the main challenge was that the mooring I\u2019d been granted had no electricity, so four solar panels were fitted to run the lights, pumps and fridge. Not having much electric narrows down what appliances I can use, and our menu had to be designed to suit. There\u2019s no freezer or microwave so the food is all made fresh and when we run out, it\u2019s gone. </p> <p>The main issue is kitchen space which means I have to shop daily, and me and the team are now a whizz at avoiding one another when cooking, serving and making drinks. It can be hard work getting rid of the rubbish and recycling and I have to be sure that the water tank is full enough for the washing up, because we have no mains water supply. </p> <p>We serve cakes and lunches and, because I\u2019m moored mostly in one location, people have got to know where we are. The first time I left the mooring a few people worried that I had disappeared for good, so now I put out a notice to say when I\u2019ll be back or a \u201cgone cruising\u201d sign.

From around Easter to autumn we get out on the waterways and make for a wide range of festivals and floating markets around the country. We had an established antiques business before trying out trading from our boat; once afloat, we discovered that a lot of people involved with canals are fascinated by history and want to buy objects that come from traditional old working boats, so we source and sell a lot of that. </p> <p>Travelling around means we can also reach people using the towpaths for leisure who might not have thought they liked antiques, but find they love the jewellery and kitchenalia we stock that isn\u2019t that expensive. </p> <p>The weather can be tricky \u2013 very hot summers can stop you dead in your tracks if the canals are short of water \u2013 but there\u2019s no doubt that selling off the boat has become the major strand of our business.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.thebookbarge.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Book Barge</a> travels across the UK and France and is run by</strong><strong> Sarah Henshaw</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d8bfd9c5f11a1c1d3019e879bc803e4e8a1698af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8bfd9c5f11a1c1d3019e879bc803e4e8a1698af/0_917_1916_1149/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With limited space, the Book Barge is selective with the items it sells\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With limited space, the Book Barge is selective with the items it sells.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When I set up in 2009, lots of indie bookshops were closing so having a quirky premises seemed a good USP. Small retailers can flourish if they offer a different shopping experience and the opportunity to hop aboard a boat certainly does that. Running costs are arguably cheaper than a traditional high street premises \u2013 just a trading licence from the <a href=\"http://www.canalrivertrust.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Canal &amp; River Trust</a> and, if you\u2019re static rather than continuously cruising, a marina or mooring fee. There\u2019s a certain flexibility that comes with retail on the waterways \u2013 the \u2018if business is bad, move on\u2019 logic. </p> <p>Boat businesses like mine rely, to an extent, on the novelty factor to lure curious passersby, so stay in a place too long and that can disappear. The flipside is that moving between towns at 4mph takes time and fuel and days when you\u2019re not taking any money at all. </p> <p>Space limitations mean I\u2019ll never be able to compete with the sheer range of stock available in other good bookshops, which means being incredibly selective, and adding value elsewhere, whether that be free cups of tea or a programme of events. </p> <p>If you\u2019re a live-aboard boater as I am, accommodating business and home in what\u2019s effectively a 60ft corridor is tricky.

In 2013 when I was keen to leave my job \u2013 I\u2019d been teaching art in challenging schools and was pretty burned out \u2013 I started thinking about renovating a narrowboat as a small studio. The idea of doing art classes that helped people escape from their day-to-day stresses was appealing, and I felt that doing it on a narrowboat would increase the therapeutic nature of the experience. </p> <p>I still teach part-time which takes the pressure off the business \u2013 it\u2019s set up as a social enterprise \u2013 from having to provide me with a full income. My partner and I built the inside of the boat ourselves so it has been designed exactly how I wanted it. It runs fully off-grid, from solar panels, and I can power LED lighting, music and up to four sewing machines. </p> <p>The main challenge is that the Canal &amp; River Trust rules and regulations make life quite difficult for trading boaters. In Hebden Bridge, where I\u2019m based, there are limited trading places, and many of these moorings have 24hr or 48hr limits on how long you can stay. I publicise my business through social media, mostly Facebook, I have quite a large following now and I find lots of people with stressful jobs come to do classes and unwind.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://therecorddeckuk.wordpress.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Record Deck</a>, located nationwide, is owned by</strong><strong> Luke Guilford</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a78303addb32730b51f40c324950bedcd5b601dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a78303addb32730b51f40c324950bedcd5b601dd/0_1109_1920_1152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Record Deck owner Luke Guilford likes the sense of community of working on the canal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Record Deck owner Luke Guilford likes the sense of community of working on the canal</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019d owned my boat for 16 years and had been thinking about setting up the business for a while when I took the plunge in 2014.

There are lots of events, markets and festivals on the rivers and canals to attend and people say I definitely stand out from other record shops.

Hanging baskets are not for the forgetful, so if you are that, go with something perennial and drought-tolerant instead; you won\u2019t win awards, but at least you won\u2019t have the hanging basket of gloom.</p> <p>Hanging baskets can be a bit of an ecological disaster. Frilly, flamboyant or gaudy, the plants that are offered up are often bred so all the good stuff \u2013 pollen and nectar \u2013 is left out, or it\u2019s inaccessible to our native bees, or it\u2019s drenched in pesticides. Pity the poor pollinator who lands on the average basket, thrusting its head vainly into a bouquet of petals to find no supper. Still, there are plenty of plants that \u2013 though they may not be the most obvious \u2013 will work well.</p> <p>Traditionally, one of the reasons petunias, geraniums and lobelias and their like are favoured for hanging baskets is because they repeat flower. Often, naturalistic planting has a peak moment and may flower if cut back, but it may not. There have been many attempts to come up with native hanging basket mixes, but few stand up to a whole season.

The reasons for this explosion in the number of urban apiarists <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/aug/07/urban-beekeeping\">is well-documented</a>, from Londoners like myself trying to reconnect with nature and enjoying delicious locally-made honey, to city allotment holders boosting their crops and urban environmentalists attempting to save the bees. </p> <p>So are we responsible for these town centre swarms? The answer is yes, if we\u2019ve not been vigilant for telltale signs that the bees are preparing to swarm. </p> <p>From the beginning of April \u2013 or even earlier during a mild spring \u2013 beekeepers ought to be looking for clues during weekly inspections of their hive and taking steps to manage unwanted swarms by splitting the colony. If they\u2019ve learned their craft well \u2013 on numerous courses run by beekeeping associations and organisations - unwanted swarms would be a rarer occurrence. </p> <p>The problem lies with novice beekeepers who aren\u2019t cut out for their new hobby. You can\u2019t just stick a hive at the bottom of the garden or on the roof and collect the honey at the end of the summer.

You can find the swarm collector nearest to you on <a href=\"http://www.bbka.org.uk/help/find_a_swarm_coordinator.php\">the BBKA\u2019s website</a>. </p> <p>But we shouldn\u2019t forget that swarms are a magnificent act of nature and a far cry from their \u2018killer\u2019 depiction in 1970s disaster movies. Bees stock up on three day\u2019s worth of honey (their energy drink or fuel) before leaving the hive on their perilous journey to find a new home, so when they alight on a town-centre car or railings for a pit stop, they are pretty full-up and soporific.

Why didn\u2019t all the elephants go at the same time like the dinosaurs did 66 million years ago? It wasn\u2019t so much that climate change caused extinction as caused population collapses.

Across the world, and not just in Asia and Africa, elephants are celebrated in culture, a staple of stories for children, a rich and mighty symbol. Even scientists don\u2019t always object to our relentless anthropomorphism of these global citizens. \u201cThe elephant is a near person,\u201d says Menon. \u201cIts compassion, its memory \u2013 this is a remarkably intelligent beast. As a scientist, I know that elephants come very, very close to us.\u201d</p> <p>What is less widely recognised in modern-day elephants is their talent for engineering or reshaping landscapes. Such mighty beasts always have: when the fruits of the Osage orange, a North American tree, drop to the ground, nothing eats them. <a href=\"https://www.americanforests.org/magazine/article/trees-that-miss-the-mammoths/ \">The tree</a> is one of many ecological anachronisms.

A decade ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/feb/26/environment \">there was fierce debate</a> in South Africa over restarting \u201cconservation\u201d culls to save forest habitat. <a href=\"https://www.wildcru.org/members/dr-christopher-okane/\">Zoologist Dr Christopher O\u2019Kane</a>, fellow of Worcester College, Oxford, compared the browsing impact of elephants and impala and found that the long-term impact of a reasonable density of impala had a similar impact to a reasonable density elephants \u2013 culling impala could save as much woodland as culling elephants. \u201cWe don\u2019t really need to cull elephants and no one is going to do it for the foreseeable future but it may rear its head again,\u201d says O\u2019Kane. \u201cIn a perfect world, the African elephant needs a lot more space than it has.\u201d</p> <p>There are big differences between elephant species but also big cultural differences in how they are viewed. In Asia there is a long tradition of taking Asian elephants into captivity and training them. The elephant-headed Hindu god Ganesh is, appropriately enough, a remover of obstacles. Elephants are prayed to every day. \u201cIt is extraordinarily helpful that our grandmothers taught us to revere the elephant,\u201d says Menon. Despite elephants killing more than 400 people in India every year \u2013 \u201cthis is not badgers we\u2019re talking about,\u201d says Menon \u2013 here there are no suggestions it should be culled. The biggest challenge in conserving the Asian elephant? \u201cLand \u2013 nothing else,\u201d says Menon. \u201cAs Mark Twain said, \u2018buy land, they are not making it anymore\u2019. An elephant is a nomad, it has to move, you can\u2019t settle it. There are 1.26 billion people in India and a large-bodied animal that needs to move.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf2a183ffae62382a207968f5defed194e3cfab7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf2a183ffae62382a207968f5defed194e3cfab7/209_0_3887_2334/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A herd of wild elephants along with newborns cross a tea garden in Sonitpur district of Assam, about 300 km from Guwahati city, India\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A herd of wild elephants along with newborns cross a tea garden in Sonitpur district of Assam, about 300km from Guwahati city, India.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: STR/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Conservation scientists have identified 101 \u201ccorridors\u201d in India along which elephants move between core habitat, where they can feed and breed.

Unfortunately the forthcoming cold spell is going to bring an end to our extended Christmas.\u201d</p> <p>By contrast, the prospect of a cold snap is more likely to be appreciated by the nation\u2019s gardeners and fruit farmers because a continuation of the current mild weather would pose serious problems for growers of apple and pear trees and blackcurrant bushes, said Guy Barter, of the Royal Horticultural Society.</p> <p>\u201cIf the mild weather were to continue for much longer, then there would be a danger that the nation\u2019s fruit trees would flower too early \u2013 in March or April \u2013 when they would then be vulnerable to a sharp frost that would destroy their blossom. And, of course, if that were to happen, they would bear no fruit.</p> <p>\u201cIn addition, if apple, pear or blackcurrant plants were to flower early, they may do so at a time when there were few bees about and so they would not be pollinated. A cold spell that would return fruit tree flowering to its normal season is therefore to be welcomed by most farmers and fruit growers.\u201d</p> <p>This point was underlined by Lee Abbey of the National Farmers Union. \u201cThe mild winter has encouraged some plants to flower early, and others to reach maturity at a time when consumer demand has not reached its peak. There are also challenges with crops in storage, particularly those that rely on ambient temperatures to preserve their quality. On the other hand, UK growers are experienced in dealing with unusual weather patterns.\u201d</p> <p>In fact, the entire food chain can be affected by unusual weather conditions, a point stressed by Buckingham. \u201cIt may sound paradoxical, but mild weather can often produce dramatic reductions in insect populations. Very cold weather kills off viruses and bacteria in the soil whereas in mild weather they thrive. They then infect and kill off large numbers of insects, including native species of butterflies and moths.</p> <p>\u201cTheir numbers drop, and that has consequences later in the year when native birds, such as wrens and goldcrests, do not have enough food to feed their chicks \u2013 which then starve. Prolonged mild weather can have unexpected and pervasive effects.\u201d</p> <h2>Winners and losers as warm weather ends<br></h2> <p><strong>Winners</strong></p> <p><strong>Otters</strong> Lower river levels in drier, colder weather mean they won\u2019t seek food on land and risk death on the roads.</p> <p><strong>Fruit farmers </strong>The appearance of early blossom will be delayed, reducing the risk of crop losses.</p> <p><strong>Wrens and goldcrests </strong>Viruses and bacteria will be less likely to kill off the insects on which they prey.</p> <p><strong>Losers</strong></p> <p><strong>Cornifrons ulceratalis</strong> <strong>moth</strong> A stranger to the UK until this winter, it survives here only in mild weather.</p> <p><strong>Squirrels </strong>The rodents have become used to gorging on easily available acorns and other foods.</p> <p><strong>Asparagus farmers </strong>The mild weather held the promise of early bumper crops.</p>", "wordcount": "797"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "lifeandstyle/2015/jun/22/stop-sixth-mass-extinction-garden-grow-wild", "type": "article", "sectionId": "lifeandstyle", "sectionName": "Life and style", "webPublicationDate": "2015-06-22T13:31:02Z", "webTitle": "I\u2019m doing my bit to stop the sixth mass extinction \u2013 letting my garden go wild", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/22/stop-sixth-mass-extinction-garden-grow-wild", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/22/stop-sixth-mass-extinction-garden-grow-wild", "fields": {"byline": "Michele Hanson", "body": "<p>Depressing news.

This held that private risk capital beats public money in funding infrastructure, its inherent efficiency more than compensating for the profit taken.</p> <p>Since the halcyon 1980s and 1990s, the theory has rapidly declined. John Major\u2019s government pledged that under rail privatisation, the track and signalling would get no public subsidy. The private sector would also build hospitals more cheaply.

It took two Lib Dem energy secretaries, Chris Huhne&#xa0;and Ed Davey, no time to renege on that as the nuclear construction lobbyists got to work on them.</p> <p>There is no way big infrastructure projects can be outside politics, and thus&#xa0;\u201cprivatised\u201d. The state will always trump the&#xa0;private sector. Such hysteria surrounds nuclear energy that security has rendered it irrationally controversial and expensive. The result, as the energy economist Dieter Helm points out, is that \u201cnuclear energy is a societal choice\u201d, not a matter of business.

It had to pretend to Brussels this&#xa0;was not a subsidy because consumers, not taxpayers, were the ones being ripped off. It also had to pretend that guarantees were not subsidies. The Chinese wanted not just a return of 10%&#xa0;but a guarantee of 10%. Osborne has in effect borrowed \u00a32bn for Britain from China at five times the cost of public sector bonds.</p> <p>This is not privatisation, any more than HS2 or third runways are privatisation.

She wanted to keep bees on it. Don was outwardly approving, although I thought I saw something in&#xa0;his eyes suggesting she would be better off seeking planning permission for a scaffolding yard. She asked him what was the best time to prune trees. \u201cThe simple answer is about six months ago,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Big Dreams, Small Spaces is not like a&#xa0;BBC makeover show of old, where a wisecracking team of experts was put to&#xa0;work setting things right on a tight timetable.

I\u2019m sure this isn\u2019t just a&#xa0;budget-slashing exercise, but a deliberate choice designed to show that the hard work of gardening is its own reward. As a sometime gardener, I know this is true, for about half an hour. It also makes practical sense: Don has six of these programmes to get through, each featuring two gardens, and only a&#xa0;single growing season to film it all. That\u2019s a lot of flying visits. He must have spent all summer in his car.</p> <p>As infrequent as his interventions are, he\u2019s always right, which must be&#xa0;maddening. Nighat had to go back&#xa0;and&#xa0;buy more plants, just as he had warned she would have to. He graciously conferred his blessing on the kinked path Glenn and Zoe had added in his absence, with a smile that hinted they would rue the day they messed with his design.</p> <p>Along with some friends and neighbours, Don got stuck in helping to&#xa0;install their retaining wall system, about which he had already expressed scepticism disguised as curiosity. \u201cIt\u2019s&#xa0;not long before Monty discovers a&#xa0;problem,\u201d said the voiceover.

Sea kale, with its young foliage the colour of red cabbage and later sprawl of honey-scented flowers, <em>Baptisia</em> \u2018Chocolate Chip\u2019, in dusky tones that suit the rusted tin, and a good hybrid <em>Phlomis</em> called \u2018Edward Bowles\u2019. This is creamy yellow like its parent <em>P russelliana</em>, but takes on a semi shrubby form from <em>P fruticosa</em>. <em>Euphorbia</em> \u2018Copton Ash\u2019 is new to me with low, glaucous foliage and lime-green flowers. Drifting, as if self-sown, crimson <em>Dianthus cruentus</em>, lilac <em>Centranthus locoqi</em> and <em>Beupleurum perfoliatum</em> mingle throughout.</p> <p>I planted openly to broadcast a seed mix I\u2019d made up of plants that I knew would take to the dry, loose shingle. Evening primrose, bronze fennel, sweetly scented <em>Matthiola incana</em> \u2018Alba\u2019 and \u2018Miss Willmott\u2019s Ghost\u2019, <em>Eryngium giganteum</em>.

If you realise it\u2019s going to be a good tomato year and you don\u2019t have nearly enough plants, use the sideshoots as cuttings. You normally pinch off sideshoots (these grow out between the leaf and the main stem) when they are 2.5cm or so; but for cuttings, leave them until they are 10-20cm long. Sit these in a glass of water until they root, or pot them up (if under cover, plant the cuttings direct into the beds). If you put them in compost or soil, it\u2019s essential to water every day for the first two weeks, or the cuttings will wither and die. After that, you\u2019ll find they romp away and you should have fruit by the end of the summer.</p> <p>Similarly, if you are thinning out other seedlings and any have a decent root system, carefully transplant them, making sure to water them in well, and continue to do so if the weather is warm. These seedlings, particularly lettuce and radish, will mature roughly two weeks after the rest, so that\u2019s a neat trick to guarantee flawless succession. In fact, this approach works for pretty much everything other than carrots, which thoroughly resent the disturbance and cross their&#xa0;legs in protest.</p> <p>If life has run away with you and you still have parsnips or leeks in the ground, just let them flower. The bees will love them and they will then set seed; scatter the seeds wherever you want leeks or parsnips next year, think nothing more of it and, come next spring, you\u2019ll have the earliest crop imaginable with little effort.</p> <p>You can cheat with supermarket herbs, too. A&#xa0;well-chosen pot of parsley, basil or chives can easily be split into individual plants. Don\u2019t bother trying this with coriander, though; it will resent being transplanted and bolt to flower. One pot of supermarket parsley will edge an entire bed, while a single pot of basil, once split, will provide you with enough plants to make vats of pesto.</p> <p>Come to think of it, this can be a very economical way to get a&#xa0;head start. Sit the pot in water for half an hour before you split the plants up: this will make it easier to loosen the root ball without tearing too many roots (they are often very congested). Pinch back the top shoot of the basil, so it branches out \u2013 these crowded individuals tend to be rather leggy \u2013 and water every other day, if necessary, until you see new growth, which is a sign the roots have bedded down.</p>", "wordcount": "496"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}, {"id": "environment/2015/may/15/a-climate-change-poem-for-today-extinction-by-jackie-kay", "type": "article", "sectionId": "environment", "sectionName": "Environment", "webPublicationDate": "2015-05-15T08:25:31Z", "webTitle": "A climate change poem for today: Extinction by Jackie Kay", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/15/a-climate-change-poem-for-today-extinction-by-jackie-kay", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/may/15/a-climate-change-poem-for-today-extinction-by-jackie-kay", "fields": {"body": "<p>We closed the borders, folks, we nailed it.</p> <p>No trees, no plants, no immigrants.</p> <p>No foreign nurses, no Doctors; we smashed it.</p> <p>We took control of our affairs.

The suggestion that London\u2019s mayor, who for years has been an energetic champion of interfaith understanding and at the forefront of urging his fellow British Muslims to follow his example by <a href=\"https://www.fabians.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/FairnessNotFavours.pdf\">participating in mainstream politics</a>, is engaged in a secret plan to fill the British capital with foreign jihadists is poisonous, imbecilic drivel. But as 2016 has taught us, ignorant fantasists, loudmouth bigots and dirty propagandists anywhere in the western world can no longer be just laughed at and dismissed.</p> <p>They get rewarded with newspaper columns and radio shows, because the conflicts they stir up are good for business. They influence elections. They even win them. In the UK, they and their opportunist fellow travellers prevailed in the EU referendum. As the year\u2019s end approaches, they are crowing, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/20/nigel-farage-accuses-jo-cox-widower-brendan-cox-of-supporting-extremism\">smearing</a>, jeering and gleefully anticipating a 2017 in which their triumphs will continue across the West. They are hell bent on wrenching Britain out of the EU as quickly and completely as possible and the bees in their bonnets buzz that leaving will be just the start of a glorious restoration, a cathartic national purging of all that they recoil from as unnatural and unclean.</p> <p>That is the new mood encircling remain-voting London with its 300 languages, its ethnic and cultural \u201c<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/71d04768-63af-11e5-9846-de406ccb37f2\">super-diversity</a>\u201d and its Muslim mayor, the son of migrants from Pakistan. On bad days the capital can feel, more than ever, like an island of social and economic liberalism, not to mention Labour Party strength, in a blue Home Counties sea and, since 23 June, amid a wider national ocean that is swelling with resentment and rage.</p> <p>The referendum outcome cannot be explained by geography alone: both Birkbeck professor <a href=\"http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/personal-values-brexit-vote/\">Eric Kaufmann</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.britishelectionstudy.com/bes-resources/brexit-britain-british-election-study-insights-from-the-post-eu-referendum-wave-of-the-bes-internet-panel/#.WGQH77aLQnc\">British Election Survey</a> team have shown how values, nostalgia and social psychology cut across spatial categories and those of income too; Scotland\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-36599102\">blanket \u201cin\u201d vote</a> shows the limitations of any town-versus-country characterisation of the EU result, as does the fact that some of England\u2019s other big cities voted strongly to remain (Manchester, Liverpool, Bristol) while others opted narrowly to leave (Birmingham, Sheffield, Nottingham). But British voters in no English big city <em>region</em> as a whole wanted to stay in the EU as heartily as London, which voted 60% to remain. Look at the leave margins in Bolton (64%), Oldham (61%) and Wigan (64%) and grasp why Andy Burnham, Labour\u2019s candidate to become Greater Manchester\u2019s first directly elected \u201cmetro mayor\u201d next year, has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/16/take-back-control-immigration-debate-labour\">speaking up</a> about doorstep concerns over free movement of workers.</p> <p>Burnham\u2019s stance and that of Khan, who says he voted for Burnham to become Labour leader in 2015, could hardly contrast more sharply, reflecting a highly fragmented UK. The \u201cLondon is Open\u201d campaign Khan launched the month after the EU vote was the start of a sustained drive to maintain the city\u2019s status as a magnet for international visitors, labour, investment and trade. It underlines the differences in attitudes between the millions of Britons in the London metropolis and the majority of their compatriots.</p> <p>In so doing, it also underlines how the capital and its Labour mayor represent so much of what Brexit Britain resents and fears. It is the city the then British National Party leader Nick Griffin ludicrously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/oct/23/bnp-nick-griffin-question-time\">described</a> in 2009 as \u201cno longer British\u201d and as \u201cethnically cleansed\u201d of British people. It is the London Nigel Farage <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/feb/28/nigel-farage-ukip-immigration-speech\">disparaged</a> in 2014 as being like \u201ca foreign land\u201d because he heard languages other than English being spoken on a train from Charing Cross. What an irony it is that the UK whose independence from the EU the erstwhile Ukip leader so fervently craves is now likely to become even more reliant on \u201cforeign\u201d London, with its teeming immigrants, its \u201cmetropolitan elite\u201d and that Muslim mayor, than it already is.</p> <h2>Dependency culture</h2> <p>Bear with me while I strap some armour on. I agree with Philip Hammond\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/nov/24/london-and-the-chancellors-2016-autumn-statement\">autumn statement</a> remark that \u201cfor too long economic growth in our country has been too concentrated in London and the south east\u201d. I\u2019ve no quarrel with the government protesting that it\u2019s time to narrow the north-south divide. When people from elsewhere complain that \u201cLondon gets everything\u201d I, a dedicated Londoner since migrating to the capital from a very different part of England 37 years ago, can see what they mean. I am uneasy about the capital inhaling ambitious young people from all corners of the land and only breathing them out when they retire to Surrey. So it is not with any cavalier, Big Smoke sneer that I break it gently to Leave Nation that Remain City is going to go on giving it an awful lot of what it needs. </p> <p>Here\u2019s something else the chancellor said: \u201cLondon is one of the highest productivity cities in the world and we should celebrate that fact\u201d. He went on to note that no other economically big league nation has such a massive output gap between its first city and the rest. He could have rubbed some noses in the detail: London contributes a massive 23% of the UK\u2019s annual economic output; London has been growing half as fast again as the UK\u2019s nations and regions as a whole; thinktank Centre for Cities has calculated that London contributes 30% of all UK taxes that are dependent on growth - such as on income, land and property \u2013 which is as much tax altogether as the next 37 largest UK cities combined; a report compiled for Brexit poster boy Boris Johnson when he was London mayor found that the equivalent of \u00a32,500 per Londoner is exported to the rest of the UK every year.</p> <p>So, even as things stand, the rest of Britain gets a hefty subsidy from the capital. Roads and bus services in Barnsley (68% leave), schools in Boston (76% leave) and health services in Blaenau Gwent (62% leave) are all helped by the contributions of a workforce that speaks 300 languages and around 40% of which was born abroad. Most especially, they are helped by London\u2019s financial sector, habitat of \u201cthe bankers\u201d whose industry and employees continue, like it or not, to do a lot to keep the UK and its people afloat.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to see that dependency decreasing. London\u2019s economy has proved more resilient than that of the UK as a whole to economic shocks in the recent past. It came through the last recession relatively unscathed, its business organisations are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/oct/18/london-business-chief-we-will-find-a-way-through-brexit-but-government-must-help\">stoutly upbeat</a> and Hammond has at least done some of the things, notably on affordable housing, the capital needs him to do if it\u2019s to keep on propping up the rest of the country. Business rate revaluation, which will see increases in the capital and the opposite elsewhere, have been criticised by Khan and the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry, yet may end up looking like the start of a national rescue operation. In <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/8689\">the words</a> of the Institute for Fiscal Studies: \u201cIt will contribute to the ongoing trend of the UK government becoming more and more dependent on revenue from London to fund services across the whole\u201d.</p> <p>But what if, as some detect, the capital\u2019s power is already fading? Other European cities - <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/17/dublin-exploits-brexit-uncertainty-to-lure-firms-from-london\">Dublin</a>, Paris, Frankfurt, Berlin, Amsterdam and more \u2013 have been making overtures to international City firms. Reports suggest that tens of thousands of Square Mile jobs could disappear if passporting rights \u2013 a mechanism enabling London companies to operate freely across the EU nations \u2013 are lost under the Brexit terms, an outcome thought increasingly likely as the prime minister makes immigration curbs her top priority. Companies in other sectors are putting investment decisions on hold until the departure deal becomes clearer. Construction has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cb0e61fc-8a0f-11e6-8aa5-f79f5696c731\">picked up</a>, but it\u2019s an industry heavily staffed by non-British EU workers. Whatever its hopes of sunny uplands ahead, the country cannot afford to let its capital decline. So while it might gratify some to metaphorically slaughter the London cash cow, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/oct/15/theresa-may-brexit-strategy-could-depend-on-giving-london-more-autonomy\">Brexit Britain</a> is going to have to keep on feeding and milking it.</p> <h2>Khan\u2019s capital</h2> <p>When he crushed Tory Brexiter Zac Goldsmith to become mayor in May, Sadiq Khan did not expect to be spending much of the rest of 2016 and beyond coping with the consequences of leaving the EU. Having deployed his pro-EU views during the mayoral fight as part of depicting Goldsmith as a backwoods toff, he then played a prominent part in the remain campaign. This included keeping a promise to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/30/david-cameron-sadiq-khan-eu-remain\">share a platform</a> with David Cameron, despite the then prime minister having <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/apr/20/london-mayor-cleric-cameron-said-supports-is-confirms-he-backed-conservatives\">disgracefully</a> joined in with the attempts to smear him as an apologist for Islamist fanatics. There was more to this than sticking to his word. Khan needed a working relationship with the then Conservative premier. He needed London to stay in the EU. The referendum outcome changed everything. <br></p> <p>It had always been Khan\u2019s intention to lobby national government for greater powers and resources, as his predecessors Johnson and Ken Livingstone had done \u2013 that\u2019s par for the mayoral course. But Brexit has added urgency to that mission and with it some theoretical extra leverage. The Khan administration\u2019s early dealings with Cameron\u2019s ministers were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/aug/01/sadiq-khan-bangs-the-london-drum-next-to-ministers-listening-ears\">encouraging</a>: they seemed to get the point that London is different and that the country needs it to stay strong. Then came the dramas of the Tory leadership succession and a new government line-up under the mutely pro-remain Theresa May. Khan\u2019s purchase with these has been variable, perhaps reflecting the new prime minister\u2019s eagerness to break with the perception of Cameron and his coterie as London trendies, perhaps a lack of policy coherence on her part, perhaps her attitude to the London mayor himself.</p> <p>As home secretary, May made her own <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3532474/Sadiq-Khan-isn-t-fit-Mayor-London-links-extremists-declares-Theresa-Tories-turn-heat-Labour-candidate.html\">small contribution</a> to Goldsmith and the Tory media\u2019s dishonest \u201cextremist links\u201d attacks. Of more relevance now are stories of her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/dec/14/is-the-government-truly-on-londons-side\">annoyance with her chancellor</a> for meeting Khan prior to the autumn statement without her say so. Would a prime minister sure of her ground have reacted so strongly? Would one firmly committed to giving London more autonomy in the national interest have allowed her transport secretary, Brexiter Chris Grayling, to dump an agreement made between his predecessor and Khan\u2019s to devolve control of suburban rail services to Transport for London, seemingly for reasons of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/sep/14/is-chris-grayling-really-sold-on-london-suburban-rail-devolution\">politics and personal dislike</a>?</p> <p>On the other hand, Khan and his housing team are pleased with that autumn statement deal on affordable homes brokered with housing minister Gavin Barwell (who is also minister for London and a London MP). Maybe in time Khan will extract more. The autumn statement promised to eventually devolve the adult education and work and health programme budgets to London government, so that provision can be designed and precious resources used to best local effect. The wheels of Whitehall are moving very slowly, though. Khan would also like London to run its own post-16 skills training and, ideally, secure much more direct freedom to spend taxes, especially property taxes, <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/gla_migrate_files_destination/Raising%20the%20capital_0.pdf\">raised from the capital</a> <em>in</em> the capital in ways that he and the London boroughs see fit, although the latter in particular still seems a long way off.</p> <p>He is, though, pressing on with developing the proposals that so inflamed the Express, for a London-only work visa which would enable London employers to continue to recruit workers from EU countries with ease. It\u2019s not an outlandish idea: such \u201casymmetric\u201d migration arrangements have been made in other countries, notably Canada. Khan is pleased to be <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MayorofLondon/status/758325834394599425\">sitting down</a> once a month with Brexit secretary David Davis, with whom he apparently gets on well. They have things in common: a Tooting council estate upbringing is the most obvious; past concerns about controversial extradition treaties is another. </p> <p>Meanwhile, he\u2019s getting on with the business of exercising the uneven spread of powers he currently has. As he says himself, he\u2019s only <a href=\"https://social.shorthand.com/MayorofLondon/ngSvhNGApP/2016\">just getting started</a> in a job where it takes a long time to get big things done. He\u2019ll come under heavy opposition pressure from the first working day of the New Year, especially over the ambiguous phrasing of his fares freeze pledge and the detail of his first budget. London Assembly Tories think he\u2019s better at politics than administration and will eventually come unstuck. Tactically, he\u2019s been quite defensive, sharply so at times, determined to give nothing away. His question time performances have been bus parking exercises, executed rigidly. To extend the football metaphor, he\u2019s been more of a Mourinho than a Klopp. </p> <p>In some policy areas Khan could and could maybe afford to be bolder. In time, he might do well to become more expansive about the city of opportunity he wants to build, and a more complete advocate for those many Londoners struggling to make ends meet. That said, he and his team have been pleasingly workmanlike so far. Their know-how and industry come as a relief after Johnson\u2019s showy but complacent and sometimes slapdash eight years. Just as he weighed up and defeated his rivals to become his party\u2019s mayoral candidate and then did the same to Goldsmith to punishing effect, Khan has sized up the job of bossing City Hall from a starting point on the practical Labour left and proceeded with focus and energy. It\u2019s a task for a pragmatist, an alliance-builder and a persuader. He\u2019s addressing it with application and energy.</p> <p>His election win and his efforts in post so far should not be undervalued by the progressive left (whatever that is these days). It may seem small consolation for being battered by Brexit, terrified by Trump and depressed by the consolidation of Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader. But it already serves as an example being adapted by Labour politicians seeking to become \u201cmetro mayor\u201d leaders of other English big city regions next spring. </p> <p>Burnham\u2019s immigration intervention puts a clear distance on the issue between himself and his party leader. Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-37024072\">Steve Rotheram</a>, Labour\u2019s candidate for the Liverpool city region and Corbyn\u2019s parliamentary private secretary, has echoed a Khan election campaign slogan by saying he would want to be \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Steve4LCRmayor/status/804430663927492608\">the most business-friendly metro mayor possible</a>\u201d. Big city mayors may represent Labour\u2019s best chance of surviving as a plausible party of national government. </p> <p>As for everyone else, they will view Khan\u2019s mayoralty much as they view London - with everything from delight to dislike, with some of the latter of the vicious variety triggered by places and people wrongly deemed irredeemably alien. Alas for those so afflicted, the country needs a thriving London. Its mayor can help that to happen, which is why, in 2017, Brexit Britain needs more success for Sadiq Khan. </p> <p><em>Dave Hill\u2019s book Zac versus Sadiq: the Fight to Become London Mayor can be purchased from the <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/zac-versus-sadiq.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">Guardian Bookshop</a> or <a href=\"http://davehill.typepad.com/double_q_books/2016/08/one.html\">directly from the author</a>. </em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 3 January 2017 to recognise that voters in the area covered by the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/liverpool-devolution-deal\">Liverpool City Region devolution agreement of November 2015</a> voted narrowly to remain.</p>", "wordcount": "2860"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "travel/2015/jun/14/iceland-tomatoes-bloody-mary-geothermal", "type": "article", "sectionId": "travel", "sectionName": "Travel", "webPublicationDate": "2015-06-14T06:00:05Z", "webTitle": "The foodie traveller on \u2026 probably the best bloody mary in the world", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/jun/14/iceland-tomatoes-bloody-mary-geothermal", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2015/jun/14/iceland-tomatoes-bloody-mary-geothermal", "fields": {"byline": "Emily Payne", "body": "<p>The landscapes of southern Iceland, full of geysers and glaciers, are probably the last place you\u2019d expect to find some of the world\u2019s juiciest tomatoes.

Nearly 30 years ago, he moved next door, into a converted barn where he and his wife, Sue, raised their three children and made a garden of their own.</p> <p>At the same time he has built up <a href=\"http://www.tomstuartsmith.co.uk\">an international garden design practice</a>, won a shelf-full of Chelsea gold medals and gained a reputation for work that is cerebral in conception and supremely beautiful in execution.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"93188a773d1bdf8979bfa9760b8f8f37e0b7917c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/93188a773d1bdf8979bfa9760b8f8f37e0b7917c/0_0_2889_3427/843.jpg\" alt=\"Photograph of grass pass through meadow\" width=\"843\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A grass path runs through a perennial meadow of rudbeckia and asters.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marianne Majerus/Garden Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The barn garden is both Stuart-Smith\u2019s test bed and his inspiration. \u201cIf I haven\u2019t done something myself, I always feel a bit of a fraud suggesting it to clients,\u201d he says. \u201cFortunately, I have been able to gradually extend our boundaries as we have bought land from my brother, who owns the surrounding farmland.\u201d</p> <p>These days, Stuart-Smith gardens on a grand scale. He has more than half an acre of ornamental gardens near the house, six acres of enriched wildflower meadows, swaths of woodland and, since 2010, a half-acre prairie meadow. \u201cI was attracted to the prairie concept because it is such a different way of managing the land,\u201d he says.</p> <p>In part it is a deconstruction of the new perennial style pioneered by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/apr/07/piet-oudolf-garden-designer\">Piet Oudolf</a>, in part a heightened interpretation of the sort of natural prairies still to be found in the American midwest. Perennial plants, especially American natives such as echinaceas and rudbeckias, are grown in close proximity to create a self-sustaining community that requires little conventional management. It is a bonus that many of these plants flower later in the year, extending the season right through October.</p> <p>\u201cI needed to raise my own prairie from seed to understand the development and management of this style of planting,\u201d Stuart-Smith says. In search of an appropriate seed mix, he turned to <a href=\"https://www.shef.ac.uk/landscape/staff/profiles/jhitchmough\">James Hitchmough</a>, professor of horticultural ecology at the University of Sheffield, who collaborated on the vast planting schemes at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jul/20/gardens-wildflowers-olympic-park\">London Olympic site</a>.</p> <p>For Stuart-Smith, Hitchmough tailored a combination of more than 50 species, predominantly from North America, chosen to suit a site that was largely free-draining, with one area of compressed clay. The seed weighed less than a bag of sugar but cost several thousand pounds. With much at stake, the site was prepared meticulously. First, the entire area was sprayed with weed killer, then marked out in a swirling pattern of meandering paths and enormous undulating beds. These beds were covered in a 10cm layer of sand, doing double duty as a weed-suppressing mulch and a free-draining seed bed. The seed was bulked out with huge quantities of sawdust, making it easier to distribute evenly and, on a windless day, the prairie was sown.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"88d74a0ec824bbaec7f3da8a42782e468e0cdae2\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/10/8/1444304175832/97bbda5c-8ea4-4429-8827-9019b633a97c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Deam\u2019s coneflower (Rudbeckia fulgida var. deamii)Tom Stuart-Smith's perennial meadow\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">North American natives such as deam\u2019s coneflower (<em>Rudbeckia fulgida </em>var.<em> deamii</em>) are tightly packed together, creating a self-sustaining community of perennial plants.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marianne Majerus/Garden Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite such careful preparation, the first year was \u201ca nightmare\u201d, says Stuart-Smith. \u201cYou need the utmost vigilance in those early days.

But weed meticulously for the first year or so and the prairie will pretty much look after itself after that.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1cf3fb51af188e3b72cb0de8e05a3723fc496355\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cf3fb51af188e3b72cb0de8e05a3723fc496355/37_566_1090_1221/893.jpg\" alt=\"Photograph of aster and snakeroot\" width=\"893\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sky blue aster and button snakeroot.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marianne Majerus/Garden Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cMaintenance is simple: early each spring, we cut it all down.

It\u2019s one of those plants that knows exactly where to seed itself \u2013 never where you might imagine, but once you see it there, resplendent with its large leaves, you think, \u201cHow clever.\u201d</p> <p>In a similar vein is <a href=\"http://digitalbotanicgarden.blogspot.co.uk/2011/06/plantago-major-rosularis-plantaginaceae.html\"><em>P. major</em> \u2018Rosularis\u2019</a>, which has been in cultivation since medieval times. Its strange double flowers are often described as rose-like. I think a rose might be angered by this description: they are large and green and very odd, though in a good way. It reaches 15cm or so and is happy in shade or sun, self-seeding readily. It loves gravel paths and well-drained margins, though if you give it lush conditions it will rise to the challenge in a luxurious manner. <a href=\"http://www.plant-world-seeds.com/store/view_seed_item/1063?itemname=PLANTAGO+MAJOR+%27FRILLS%27\"><em>P. major </em>\u2018Frills\u2019</a> is a curly, parsley-like version that looks best in a pot, where you can admire its strangeness up close, but is lost among other things in a border.</p> <p>If you can\u2019t get hold of a plant, you can sow these varieties at any time of year, though spring is fastest and the majority of the seed will wait till then.

The leaves work wonderfully in salads when picked young and crunchy, or lightly steamed as a vehicle for butter. It\u2019s a tough nut, growing in heavily compacted ground, and doesn\u2019t even mind being trampled on.

Their mission of discovery is charted in a book they cowrote, <em>The Hidden Half of Nature</em>, out in the UK this week.</p> <p>Looking out of the kitchen window at their labrador retriever, Loki, sniffing around the roots of a viburnum tree, Bikl\u00e9 says: \u201cIt all began 15 years ago.

She added a little \u201czoo doo\u201d \u2013 faeces from grazing animals such as hippos and giraffes at the nearby zoo, which has little smell \u2013 and home-brewed compost tea from worm castings, kelp and molasses.</p> <p>She said: \u201cI\u2019d tour around four or five Starbucks and fill up the car with 20 to 30 bags \u2013 they\u2019re happy to give them to you.

When we learnt about that, it was like, oh, there\u2019s a hidden microbial world down there and it was fascinating.\u201d</p> <p>There are more microbes in a teaspoon of soil than there are people on the planet and they are everywhere, in water, air, earth, as well as inside our bodies and on our skin. Without them we couldn\u2019t digest food, plants wouldn\u2019t grow and there wouldn\u2019t be enough oxygen for us to breathe. There are thought to be 2-3bn microbial species, divided into six groups: bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa, algae and archaea. They\u2019ve had a bad press for much of the past century because some of them are nasty \u2013 the pathogens \u2013 and cause diseases such as TB, chickenpox and malaria, but most are harmless or helpful.</p> <p>The husband and wife team was so amazed at the symbiotic relationship between microbes and plant roots that they initially decided to write a book on soil restoration. Plants can\u2019t get the nutrition they need from soil without the help of microbes \u2013 particularly bacteria and fungi \u2013 which create nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium and other nutrients in a form the plant cells can absorb. Microbes take the carbon they need to live from organic matter (the woodchips, coffee grounds and leaves that Bikl\u00e9 was laying down) and also get some food from plant roots that exude sugars and amino acids. Microbes, they explained, also defend plants against disease-causing pathogens.</p> <p>Montgomery says: \u201cAnne was feeding the microbes \u2013 the invisible part of nature \u2013 which feeds and protects the visible part.

The new method uses much less water and energy than open soil farming, and requires no pesticides or fungicides, but nevertheless, on most hydroponic farms, chemicals are used to sterilise the water, and some nutrients are synthesised. </p> <p> The Soil Association also refuses to recognise hydroponic plants as organic; a source of frustration to Fry, who thinks changing the mindset of modern agriculture is paramount. \u201cWe need to start growing crops in peri-urban environments,\u201d he says, envisioning a future where crops are grown \u201con the tops of buildings, in disused car-parks\u201d, or anywhere, in fact, with ventilation and a power supply.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb28dd1f5c6ce6ae1271bb48e9a43d3a77262d8e\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/10/1441887069730/d3a1831e-96b9-4dee-be0a-bf8a73860970-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Growing Undeground tunnel\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of the tunnels under Clapham North, before being turned into a vertical farm.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>South London startup <a href=\"http://growing-underground.com/\">Growing Underground</a> (GU) is testing the limits of this idea.

Britain lost its appetite for frozen beef burgers. Sales plummeted, supermarkets were shunned and high street butchers sold record quantities of fresh mince. But this shift was no concerted effort to save our high streets \u2013 it was an attempt to avoid being swindled. Because besides the expected beef, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/horsemeat-scandal\" title=\"\">supermarket patties contained horsemeat</a> and pig meat too. And as the Food Standards Agency (FSA) confirmed that it wasn\u2019t only burgers but lasagne, bolognese and even some diced meat that were affected, panic ensued. Politicians demanded answers, consumers demanded honest alternatives and, as the tangled, shadowy reality of our food web was laid bare, everyone demanded assurances that it would never happen&#xa0;again.</p> <p>But it has, and it will. Indeed, since the horsemeat scandal, UK testing has revealed that <a href=\"http://www.thegrocer.co.uk/buying-and-supplying/food-safety/food-fraud-tests-reveal-25-of-dried-oregano-is-adulterated/522104.article\" title=\"\">25% of dried oregano</a> samples contain other ingredients, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-27047970\" title=\"\">40% of lamb takeaways contain other meat</a>, and more than 60% of ham and cheese pizzas tested contained <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/11841097/Two-thirds-of-takeaway-ham-and-cheese-pizzas-from-this-county-in-England-dont-contain-any-ham-or-cheese.html\" title=\"\">neither ham nor&#xa0;cheese</a>.</p> <p>Making profit by substituting expensive ingredients for cheaper ones is not a new phenomenon, probably dating back to when food first began to be traded. The first concrete evidence for genuine deceptions, however, dates from Roman times when lead was added to hide the fact that a wine had gone sour. But it is the complexity of our current food system that has created more opportunities for criminals than ever before. Food processing methods allowing us to store, preserve and sell no-fuss food have also helped create a globalised and largely anonymous food network \u2013 ideal conditions for fraudsters to operate.</p> <p>\u201cConsumer demand for low-cost, interesting and varied food available all year round means products can use many different ingredients from all over the world,\u201d says Andy Morling, head of the National Food Crime Unit at the FSA. \u201cSupply chains can therefore become impossibly complex and opaque, providing opportunities for those at home and overseas looking to make criminal profits from food. The huge sums of money involved can act as a powerful incentive.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/gallery/2016/jan/07/whats-on-your-plate-food-fraud-revealed-chorizo-baby-formula-avocado\">What's really on your plate: hidden world of food fraud revealed - in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As food scandals have become more prevalent, politicians have got wise to the problem. But calls for more coordinated and intensive monitoring as well as tighter legislation are easier said than done. Monitoring food fraud is not simple despite the hi-tech, CSI-style analytical methods available. Critically, many food frauds are highly calculated, using detailed knowledge of tests to slip under the radar of standard screenings.</p> <p>\u201cAlthough food crime has been with us for hundreds of years, it has only recently been recognised as a specific criminal typology,\u201d says Morling. \u201cAs such, the UK response to this threat is in its infancy.\u201d But, perhaps unsurprisingly, he is quick to assuage queasy stomachs. \u201cThe National Food Crime Unit (NFCU) is working hard with many partners to better understand the nature and scale of this offending and to help bring those responsible to justice. While there are vulnerabilities, food consumed in the UK is among the safest and most authentic in the world, and the work of the unit is about keeping it that way.\u201d</p> <p>Doing so, however, takes more than a beady eye. In fact it takes what is known as a \u201cfingerprint\u201d \u2013 a physical or biochemical characteristic \u2013 that either confirms the identity of the food or an adulterant. These fingerprints are like computer passwords \u2013 the more symbols they contain, the more secure the password becomes. The most sophisticated fingerprints are found in the nucleotide sequences of DNA or in the amino acid sequences of proteins, but DNA and proteins can be removed or destroyed by food processing. So alternative tests using simpler substances, such as fatty acids, sugars and pigments, may be needed to identify rogue ingredients. Additionally, the elements (carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen etc) that make up our foods give even more detail \u2013 offering clues as to the geographical origins of different foods.</p> <p>\u201cThe diversity of food ingredients is matched only by the diversity of methods in which fraud can take place,\u201d says Morling. \u201cThe many and varied testing methods available are a reflection of this. But there is no silver bullet. Defeating food crime is about more than testing products. Gathering intelligence from people is also vital.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, food forensics is a cat and mouse game with the fraudsters adapting their methods to evade new and improved testing methods. And the chase is urgent: while the horsemeat scandal of 2013 was alarming, other frauds have had far darker consequences. Nearly half of the food fraud cases recorded in the UK in 2012 were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/feb/03/huge-rise-alcohol-seizures\" title=\"\">related to fake alcohol</a> \u2013 spirits made with cheap ingredients such as chloroform and isopropyl alcohol (a solvent and fuel additive in the automotive industry). The bogus booze landed people in hospital with abdominal pain and vomiting, but it can also lead to kidney failure and death.</p> <p>Worryingly, it seems there are few foods that have not been tainted. From olive oil to fish, honey to tea and even those most hallowed of foodstuffs \u2013 organic products \u2013 betrayal lurks in our grocery bags. But researchers are fighting back with a scientific smorgasbord of their own.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ede88efe6aac9ecfe9e62afb2f1dd67b5a1e1cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ede88efe6aac9ecfe9e62afb2f1dd67b5a1e1cd/0_155_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fishmonger, Borough Market\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Choosing fish with recognisable features reduces the risk of purchasing mislabelled products.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jane Hobson/Rex Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Something fishy</h2> <p>Take a trip to a supermarket fish aisle and the problem with fish species stares you in the face. Or rather, it doesn\u2019t. Consumer demand for perfectly portioned white fillets means that most fish is sold without heads, fins and skin, presenting opportunities to label cheaper species as more expensive ones. But the scam not only deceives customers \u2013 passing off one fish as another provides a market for illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.</p> <p>Some mislabelling may be the result of confusion over the naming of species \u2013 Atlantic cod has 58 different common names in the English language alone. Europe has tried to remedy this by requiring that scientific names be included on fish labels. This, along with improvements in self-regulation within the industry, is helping. Whereas studies five years ago showed mislabelling in up to 40% of samples tested in the EU, recent testing in six European countries showed only 4.9% were mislabelled.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a positive story,\u201d says Dr Andrew Griffiths, lecturer at the University of Exeter and one of the scientists involved in the EU testing. \u201cI think this can be linked to stronger EU legislation, but also increased awareness. The press have covered the issue of species mislabelling, making consumers more aware.\u201d</p> <p>To differentiate one lump of white fish from any other, experts have turned to DNA barcoding. Fast becoming the standard method for authenticating fish species, the technique targets a particular gene in the DNA of the cell\u2019s powerhouses, mitochondria, that is variable enough to be able to differentiate between species, but doesn\u2019t vary within a species. \u201c<a href=\"http://fishbol.org/\" title=\"\">The Fish Barcode of Life Initiative</a> was one of the first taxonomically focused barcode campaigns,\u201d says Dr Robert Hanner, associate director for the Canadian Barcode of Life Network, University of Guelph, Canada. \u201cWe went out to markets in Canada and the US to get samples to test whether the database was mature enough to put species names on unknown specimens.

Many of these adulterants can be found using a microscope, even when they\u2019ve been ground beyond recognition to the naked eye.</p> <p>The recent nut scandals, however, were detected using antibodies that specifically bind to nut proteins in a method known as Elisa (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). In a nutshell (ahem), unbound antibodies are washed away, leaving the bound antibodies to be detected using light or a chemical reaction, revealing the type of nuts present. The method identified nut protein in paprika and cumin in North America \u2013 potentially lethal for anyone with a nut allergy. But in the UK, the results proved more controversial. Bart Ingredients, whose cumin products had been recalled, claimed the test being used could give a false positive because the antibodies designed to detect almond protein also bind to mahlab \u2013 a spice cultivated from a close relative of the almond tree, but not a listed allergen. The FSA rescinded the recall on the Bart ground&#xa0;cumin.</p> <p>Spice crops may be vulnerable to climate change, resulting in lower yields and a greater temptation to \u201cbulk out\u201d products to meet demands.

Mixing cheaper oil with a more expensive one, or simply substituting it altogether, can yield a bogus product with a composition indistinguishable from the expensive oil. Italian olive oil producers have come under scrutiny several times over the past decade for passing off cheaper quality oils as 100% extra-virgin.</p> <p>Corn oil was found nearly 20 years ago to be especially vulnerable to adulteration. Now purity can be assured due to a highly robust test based on the carbon isotope compositions of the fatty acid that make up the bulk of the oil. The maize plant used to produce corn oil has a different way of capturing carbon dioxide during photosynthesis compared with all the other major vegetable oil-producing plants. This improvement in testing alone led to a significant reduction in fraud.</p> <p>The same cannot be said of olive oil, which is highly vulnerable to adulteration due to the nine different grades defined by the industry and an increasing number&#xa0;of producing countries. Indeed, recent reports suggest <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/11/extra-virgin-italian-olive-oil-producers-accused-of-fraud\" title=\"\">olive oil fraud might be on the rise</a>.</p> <p>The trouble is that all of the different grades of olive oil have identical fatty acid compositions, which also overlap with other oils \u2013 especially cheaper sunflower. While chemical tests provide some insights, the ultimate assessment remains the humble taste test. Technology, however, might yet save us. The future of olive oil testing is seen in e-noses and e-tongues designed to copy the discriminatory power of human olfactory systems.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bc6806b46cd7699a4991e19aa8390892c3dcab47\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc6806b46cd7699a4991e19aa8390892c3dcab47/0_0_5616_3371/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Honey bee\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">If you thought all honey was just honey, think again\u2026</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Honey purity</h2> <p>What could be simpler or purer that a shining glass of golden honey? Almost anything, it turns out. Honey is in the top 10 of foods most likely to be adulterated \u2013 a remarkable stat considering honey requires little or no processing in its production.</p> <p>Not that the tinkering is particularly sophisticated. Honey is \u201cstretched\u201d with cheaper sugars, such as high fructose corn syrup, which has the same sugar composition as honey, thereby defying the most basic fingerprinting test.</p> <p>Like olive oil, there are many different commercial variants of honey, and labels often claim specific plants and/or countries of origin. The classic case is the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/22/manuka-is-a-taste-of-money\" title=\"\">highly prized manuka honey</a>, which is suspected of widespread adulteration based on production-sales volumes auditing. In the absence of GPS-tracked bees, scientists have had to turn to other methods to verify this breakfast-table staple, relying on a battery of tests including those based on stable isotopes, biochemical fingerprinting and DNA.</p> <p>Verifying the identity of our comestibles is undoubtedly a challenge, particularly as more and more of us rely on processed foods. But there is a simple way to outfox the fraudsters. Buy ingredients with defining features and remember, you only get what you pay for \u2013 so if it\u2019s cheap the quality will almost certainly be compromised.</p> <p><em>Sorting the Beef from the Bull: The Science of Food Fraud Forensics by Richard Evershed and Nicola Temple is published by Bloomsbury (\u00a312.99). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/371252/\" title=\"\"><em>Click here to order a copy for \u00a310.39</em></a></p>", "wordcount": "2008"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "sustainable-business/2015/jun/24/beyond-organic-promoting-indonesias-indigenous-farming-cultures", "type": "article", "sectionId": "sustainable-business", "sectionName": "Guardian Sustainable Business", "webPublicationDate": "2015-06-24T11:07:24Z", "webTitle": "Beyond organic: promoting Indonesia\u2019s indigenous farming cultures", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/jun/24/beyond-organic-promoting-indonesias-indigenous-farming-cultures", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2015/jun/24/beyond-organic-promoting-indonesias-indigenous-farming-cultures", "fields": {"byline": "Oliver Balch", "body": "<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/jun/15/the-shipping-containers-tackling-south-africas-chronic-childcare-shortages\">The shipping containers tackling South Africa's chronic childcare shortages</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The first time Helianti Hilman visited the indigenous farmers of the West Java town of Garut, she was asked to remove her shoes before entering their fields. Her surprise grew when the farmers quizzed her on her mood \u2013 they didn\u2019t want her upsetting the plants.<br></p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s when I realised that their approach to agriculture was much more than just growing organic,\u201d says 44-year-old Hilman, an Indonesian entrepreneur and former lawyer. \u201cIt was a whole way of life. That\u2019s when my perspective changed.\u201d</p> <p>That was eight years ago. Hilman\u2019s efforts to protect and promote traditional agricultural practices in Indonesia since then saw her named an <a href=\"http://www.weforum.org/news/schwab-foundation-honours-asia-social-entrepreneurs-year?news=page\" rel=\"nofollow\">Asian social entrepreneur of the year</a> by the Schwab Foundation at the World Economic Forum in March. </p> <p>The social enterprise that Hilman helped to establish in 2009 works with around 50,000 smallholder farmers across Indonesia. Called Javara (which means champion in Sanskrit) the organisation oversees the marketing and distribution of more than 640 artisanal products, from organically grown vegetables and gluten-free flour to gourmet salt and coconut cooking oil.</p> <p>According to Indonesia\u2019s national indigenous people\u2019s organisation, <a href=\"http://www.aman.or.id/en/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Aliansi Masyarakat Adat Nusantara</a> (AMAN), around one fifth of the country\u2019s 250 million people classify as indigenous. With statutory efforts to establish collective rights to customary lands yet to be officially sanctioned, rural communities remain vulnerable to the frequent land grabs made by <a href=\"http://www.forestpeoples.org/topics/responsible-finance/news/2015/04/golden-agri-resources-still-violation-rspo-standards\" rel=\"nofollow\">palm oil producers</a> and other forest users.</p> <p>Given that most Indonesian farmers live in abject poverty, there is a clear moral and developmental case for supporting them. But there are compelling sustainability reasons too, Hilman insists. </p> <p>During Indonesia\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/06/30/forty-years-after-green-revolution039.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">\u201cGreen Revolution\u201d of the 1970s</a>, farmers were encouraged by the government to adopt commercial agricultural practices. However, many indigenous people avoided this wave of modernity and still use traditional methods, and so-called heritage or heirloom seeds. </p> <p>\u201cBack in the 1960s in Indonesia, we used to have over 7,000 different rice varieties. People have forgotten this today. They are used to buying just red, white or black rice,\u201d says Hilman. The heritage plants grown by Javara\u2019s network of farmers offer a wide range of distinctive nutritional properties. And with their greater diversity comes greater resilience. Hilman cites rice varieties, for example, that can grow everywhere, from forest shade and swamps to inland lakes and saline coasts.</p> <p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t just for the foodies,\u201d she argues. \u201cThese varieties are very relevant for climate change [but] we are losing them before our eyes without even knowing it.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/mar/31/its-not-charity-the-rise-of-social-enterprise-in-vietnam\">It's not charity: the rise of social enterprise in Vietnam</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Her sense of urgency is echoed by the <a href=\"http://www.iufro.org/iufro/\" rel=\"nofollow\">International Union of Forest Research Organizations</a> (IUFR), an Austria-based nonprofit group. In a <a href=\"http://www.iufro.org/science/gfep/forests-and-food-security-panel/report/\" rel=\"nofollow\">report</a> released in May, the IUFR emphasised the role that indigenous communities can play, both in protecting forests and enhancing food security.<br></p> <p>\u201cWorking with farmers to combine the best of traditional and formal scientific knowledge offers tremendous potential [and] this contribution needs to be acknowledged and incorporated into management practices and policy,\u201d the report states. </p> <p>In Indonesia, that is easier said than done. For a start, its indigenous communities often live in remote areas \u2013 the country comprises nearly 1,000 permanently settled islands. Years of marginalisation has also left them distrustful of outsiders and unfamiliar with how mainstream markets work. </p> <p>Hilman\u2019s entry point came by way of the Integrated Pest Management Farmers\u2019 Association, a nonprofit network representing more than 1 million indigenous and smallholder farmers in Indonesia. She was invited by a group of rice growers close to her parents\u2019 home in central Java to help with marketing their produce.</p> <p>She struck lucky in 2009 when she persuaded Ranch Market, a premium supermarket in Jakarta, to stock two-dozen varieties of the farmers\u2019 rice. Orders from high-end hotels and restaurants quickly followed.</p> <p>Over time, Javara has sought gradually to overcome the knowledge gaps of its affiliated producer groups through basic management training and production advice. For the large collectives in its network, it also provides assistance with organic certification and credit for the purchase of equipment.</p> <p>Volume is the biggest sticking point. Indonesia\u2019s indigenous farmers traditionally have small plots and grow mixed crops. The notion of mono-crop production or intensive cultivation is anathema to them. One community even forbids the sale of its rice varieties, permitting only barter instead. </p> <p>Hilman\u2019s solution has been to take the farmers\u2019 specialty crops and use them to create inventive, value-added products. \u201cA buyer might ask us for a container of turmeric, and we simply don\u2019t have that much,\u201d she explains. \u201cBut we have enough turmeric to blend it with heritage rice to create turmeric-infused rice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd we\u2019re not just selling the products,\u201d she adds. \u201cWe\u2019re selling the story and benefits behind the products.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/mar/30/social-innovation-business-berlin\">Alternative economy: the rise of social innovation in Berlin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Take the tale of \u201cbee whispering\u201d, for instance.

It let me understand where I was in the landscape, and the experience was both atavistic and strangely moving. I stood there for a long time.</p> <p>It\u2019s difficult for those of us who live in urban areas \u2013 82% of us now \u2013 to get a good sense of the land on which we live. Its contours are obscured by buildings, its marshes drained, its rivers often diverted or sent underground; what we relate to on a day to day basis are its manmade features, the texture of its surface, and not the land beneath.</p> <p>Travel was once a way to understand topography, but the modern road network often disengages us from it. Most of the time, all that\u2019s visible from a motorway is fast-moving embankment or a half-mile strip of field.

Apart from a few areas of showcase open countryside we are largely confined to footpaths, and many roads are no longer safe for pedestrians \u2013 as I found when I tried to walk up Watling Street.</p> <p>Beyond the ambit of our daily routes our innate sense of Britain\u2019s features is fading, and generation by generating we are losing our instinctive understanding of the land in which we live. What we are coming to know instead are its roads.</p> <p>This growing disconnection can be traced through our literature. Born in 1793, John Clare was a poet of total relatedness, of place experienced up close and on foot. When he wrote about a chiffchaff\u2019s nest he did not mean all nests, or the idea of nests. He meant a particular nest in a particular place; a nest that he had seen. His <a href=\"http://homes.lmc.gatech.edu/~broglio/1102/swordywell.html\">Swordy Well</a> was not a metaphor, but a real place; his dotterel ash trees were actual trees. Like the coach-sick <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/grrlscientist/2013/nov/05/natural-history-selborne-gilbert-white-anne-secord-book-review\">Gilbert White </a>in Selborne, Hampshire, Clare was not looking at his home landscape; he was inside it, looking out.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/the-flitting/\">\u201cThe Flitting\u201d</a>, written in 1832 after moving away from his beloved Helpston, Clare mourned the loss of its particular and profoundly known characteristics:</p> <blockquote> <p>I miss the heath, its yellow furze,<br>Molehills and rabbit tracks that lead<br>Through beesom ling, and teasel burrs<br>That spread a wilderness indeed;<br>The woodland oaks and all below<br>That their white powdered branches shield,<br>The mossy paths: the very crow<br>Croaked music in my native fields.</p> </blockquote> <p>It\u2019s worth noting that he had moved all of three miles away.</p> <p>For William Cobbett, on one of his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2001/aug/25/artsfeatures\">\u201crural rides\u201d</a> in 1825, the type of road you chose when you travelled was beginning to make a difference to how much it told you about the countryside: \u201cThose that travel on turnpike roads know nothing of England,\u201d he wrote.</p> <p>Kipling\u2019s short story, <a href=\"http://gaslight.mtroyal.ca/they.htm\">\u201cThey\u201d</a>, was written in 1904, at the dawn of the motoring era. Open to the elements, travelling at less than 25 miles an hour and unfettered by road signs and traffic regulations \u2013 or, indeed, traffic \u2013 a drive sounds not unlike a morning\u2019s gallop on a good fast horse:</p> <blockquote> <p>One view called me to another; one hill top to its fellow, half across the county, and since I could answer at no more trouble than the snapping forward of a lever, I let the country flow under my wheels. The orchid-studded flats of the East gave way to the thyme, ilex, and grey grass of the Downs; these again to the rich cornland and fig-trees of the lower coast \u2026 I found hidden villages where bees, the only things awake, boomed in 80-foot lindens that overhung grey Norman churches; miraculous brooks diving under stone bridges built for heavier traffic than would ever vex them again.</p> </blockquote> <p>As well as its striking engagement with landscape there is a heartbreaking innocence to Kipling\u2019s story, a lack of foresight about what cars would eventually do to the places it describes. I find almost unbearably poignant the line, \u201cStone bridges built for heavier traffic than would ever vex them again\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6f98666b776fc6dbaf2b9232895480b6dbdc1492\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f98666b776fc6dbaf2b9232895480b6dbdc1492/0_0_1122_1972/569.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration from Rain\" width=\"569\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration from <em>Rain.</em></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Paul Binnie</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I love travelling by train. I love the different kind of looking it lets you do: out across a whole landscape, often; able to comprehend it in a way roads deny you, but with the sudden intimacies of back gardens, or wildlife sightings, too. On the train back from Northumberland I looked out for the halfway marker by the track: an ornate black-and-white sign with one arrow pointing north, to Glasgow, and the other south to London. It grounds you, reminding you that you\u2019re moving through counties, a country, the shape of which is familiar since childhood from maps and the weather forecast.</p> <p>Trains make me think of WH Auden, and Edward Thomas\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/adlestrop/\">Adlestrop</a>\u201d, and John Betjeman\u2019s Metroland poems; but most particularly, they make me think of Larkin. \u201c<a href=\"http://www.poetryarchive.org/poem/whitsun-weddings\">The Whitsun Weddings</a>\u201d, with its pin-sharp \u201csomeone running up to bowl\u201d is wonderful, but it\u2019s <a href=\"http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2011/03/discovering-poetry-larkins-here/\">\u201cHere\u201d</a> that haunts me with the train view\u2019s characteristic mixture of the general and the very particular. Its image of a landscape unfurling beyond the glass is extraordinary, as is the sense of passivity peculiar to train travel: the view \u201cgathers to the surprise of a large town\u201d; we merely regard it through the glass. At the poem\u2019s close the coastal landscape turns its back on us altogether with the deft inversion of \u201cends the land\u201d: it no longer relates to us, it is no longer even a view, or being viewed \u2013 but only itself.</p> <p>Yet it is the car that dominates our lives, and as time goes on there emerges in our literature a much more detached way of looking at the countryside \u2013 one that Clare, I think, would have struggled to recognise. Here is Penelope Lively in <em>The Road to Lichfield</em>, written in 1983. The trip has been planned using a road atlas and one of those little wheeled devices to calculate distance, and so it does have a sense of moving across a map \u2013 although the observable features of the landscape are now less clear:</p> <blockquote> <p>Berkshire gave way to Oxfordshire, Oxfordshire to Warwickshire, and Warwickshire to Staffordshire. A scum of insects gathered at the edge of the windscreen; the landscape lay misty and unreal at either side of the car, the road slicing through fields and villages as though it were of a different dimension, a different order of things. From time to time towns offered themselves on signposts \u2013 Daventry 12, Stratford 8, Birmingham 17. They seemed like actors in the wings, and the landscape itself a palimpsest, suggesting another time, another place.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c1b115b6885320987513be6a2ad057f857ec0276\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1b115b6885320987513be6a2ad057f857ec0276/0_0_1122_1972/569.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration from Rain.\" width=\"569\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration from Rain.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Paul Binnie</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is a modern road, not one of the old kind that have grown out of the landscape, like drovers\u2019 roads and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jun/01/holloway-robert-macfarlane-review\">holloways</a> and lanes that join one village to the next. A \u201cgood\u201d road, to the motorist, is fast, reliable and level \u2013 so the better it is the less it tells us about the landscapes it cuts through.</p> <p>The best roads by that measure are motorways, which have generated their own kind of place-writing, often (but not always) dystopian: think of JG Ballard, or Michel Faber\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/may/02/firstchapters.reviews\"><em>Under the Skin</em></a>. Here is Hilary Mantel in the opening chapter of her 2005 novel <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/apr/30/featuresreviews.guardianreview30\"><em>Beyond Black</em></a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>The motorway, its wastes looping London: the margin\u2019s scrub-grass flaring orange in the lights, and the leaves of the poisoned shrubs striped yellow-green like a cantaloupe melon. Four o\u2019clock: light sinking over the orbital road. Teatime in Enfield, night falling on Potters Bar. A sea-green sky: lamps blossoming white. This is marginal land: fields of strung wire, of treadless tyres in ditches, fridges dead on their backs, and starving ponies cropping the mud.</p> </blockquote> <p>The experience of motorway travel is so widespread it\u2019s no surprise that it\u2019s found its way into the modern novel; what interests me is the way the countryside looks through the windscreen of a fast-moving car: frequently hostile, often blank or lacking in meaning, and remote. In contrast, when Iain Sinclair wanted to write about the M25 and its surrounding landscape, for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/sep/21/featuresreviews.guardianreview6\"><em>London Orbital</em></a>, he made the circuit on foot. The result is a book that\u2019s deeply preoccupied with the topography and meaning of the places the road passes through, something he stresses could not have been achieved from a car:</p> <blockquote> <p>Driving around the road was useless, as I discovered when I endured 250 miles in a day, with Chris Petit, clockwise and anticlockwise, coming in off my old favourite, the A13 ... More was less, further was nowhere. In the morning, after we paid our pound and crossed the Queen Elizabeth Bridge, we dragged, lurched, crawled on a three-lane conveyor belt, side-on to single-occupant, lightweight jacket-on-hook, cellphone voyagers \u2026 This, according to one commuter interviewed for a television documentary, was the best of it; the highpoint of the day. Their only contact with the changing seasons, the Surrey hills, canny roadside plantings. With England.</p> </blockquote> <p>But the picture isn\u2019t simply one of growing disconnection. Air travel has given us startling new perspectives on our surroundings, allowing writers such as JA Baker, for example, to consult wartime aerial photographs of Essex and so describe in his book, <em>The </em><em>Peregrine</em>, the bird\u2019s \u201cpouring-away world of no attachment, a world of wakes and tilting, of sinking planes of land and water\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d6ddc09ef7112db0ebec02638ad0213fa966247c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6ddc09ef7112db0ebec02638ad0213fa966247c/0_0_2669_1972/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dartmoor revised\" width=\"1000\" height=\"739\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration from <em>Rain</em>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Paul Binnie</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And there are imaginative upsides to our new forms of navigation, too.

Sleepless and far from home she uses it to visit Kirkwall, zooming in on one summer morning, the cathedral clock showing 6.50. \u201cThere\u2019s a backpacker looking at a paper map, an analogue map within a digital one,\u201d she writes. She even recognises the local traffic warden, James.</p> <p>John Clare\u2019s biographer, Jonathan Bate, says that Clare was among our subtlest exponents of what Edmund Husserl called \u201cthing-experience\u201d: <em>Dingerfahrung</em>. \u201cClare\u2019s world horizon was that of the things \u2013 the stones, animals, plants and people \u2013 that he knew first, and knew best,\u201d Bate writes. \u201cWhen he went beyond that horizon, he no longer knew what he knew.\u201d</p> <p>With our cheap flights and satnavs, motorways and virtual mapping, we all exist beyond our world horizons now. Yet for me there\u2019s still no way of understanding a landscape without walking it: without using, as generations have before me, feet and body and breath.

The MHRA usually requires drugs to be of sufficient quality, safety and effectiveness but, in the case of herbal medicines, it recognised the difficulty in providing evidence of effectiveness and asked only for proof of quality and safety and patient information. Reassuringly, registration means that hundreds of potentially dangerous products have been banned.</p> <p>However, herbal practitioners don\u2019t need a licence to supply medicines that they create on their own premises following one-to-one consultations, as long as they don\u2019t contain banned substances. Practitioners may voluntarily sign up to one of a <a href=\"http://www.nimh.org.uk/\">number of organisations</a>, but these have no clout. Even if the organisation kicks them off its list for bad practice, there is nothing to stop them setting up in the high street.</p> <p>So, on the plus side, over-the-counter herbal medicines in the UK are now safe and available in a fixed dose. But is there evidence that any of them work?</p> <h2><strong>Depression</strong></h2> <p>Each year, 1.5m packs of <a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/st-johns-wort\">St John\u2019s wort</a> (Hypericum extract) are sold in the UK. <a href=\"http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg23/documents/depression-amendment-nice-guideline-draft-for-consultation2\">Trials suggest it is more effective than placebo</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16160619\">as effective as prescribed antidepressant drugs such as Prozac</a> in mild-to-moderate depression. <a href=\"http://patient.info/doctor/st-johns-wort\">Though generally safe,</a> it can interact with other drugs such as the contraceptive pill.

The risks are that either they don\u2019t work, resulting in uncontrolled diabetes, or they may work well, but in an erratic way, causing low blood sugar levels, especially when taken with conventional sugar-lowering drugs such as insulin.</p> <p><a href=\"https://nccih.nih.gov/health/ayurveda/introduction.htm\">Ayurvedic </a>physicians use a mixture of herbs and lifestyle advice. <a href=\"http://www.cochrane.org/CD008288/ENDOC_ayurvedic-treatments-for-diabetes-mellitus\">A Cochrane collaboration review of seven trials</a> of Ayurvedic medicines used to treat diabetes found some positive results and no serious side-effects, but said no firm conclusions could be drawn. Potentially harmful levels of metals, including lead, mercury and arsenic, have been found in up to a fifth of Ayurvedic products bought online.</p> <h2><strong>Asthma</strong></h2> <p>Some herbal remedies may be effective in treating asthma. <a href=\"http://thorax.bmj.com/content/55/11/925\">An analysis of 17 randomised controlled trials</a> into the use of herbal preparations in asthma (Chinese and Ayurvedic medicine) found a significant improvement in more than half of the trials. The herbs included Tylophora indica, marijuana and dried leaf extract among others, though the analysis couldn\u2019t identify which was effective. However, many herbs interact with conventional treatment. St John\u2019s wort makes the asthma-relieving drug <a href=\"http://www.drugs.com/cdi/aminophylline.html\">aminophylline</a> less effective, so symptoms may get worse. Herbalists often stock <a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/vitamins-supplements/ingredientmono-503-royal%20jelly.aspx?activeingredientidu003d503u0026activeingredientnameu003droyal%20jelly\">royal jelly, </a>made by bees, which is marketed for use in asthma, among other conditions. But <a href=\"http://www.asthma.org.uk/knowledge-bank-treatment-and-medicines-complementary-therapies\">Asthma UK strongly recommends that people with asthma and allergies don\u2019t take it</a> as there have been reports of severe, and occasionally fatal, asthma and allergic attacks.</p> <h2><strong>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)</strong></h2> <p>Many people with IBS turn to herbal medicines to help control symptoms of diarrhoea, bloating and abdominal cramps. Traditional Chinese medicine uses formulas including rhubarb, tangerine, cardamom and liquorice and five or more herbs. Individual herbs can be used for specific symptoms; UK doctors prescribe <a href=\"http://patient.info/medicine/peppermint-oil-capsules-apercap-colpermin-mintec\">peppermint oil capsules</a> for bloating and cramps in IBS, even though evidence is limited. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10793599\">Ginger</a> is widely believed to help nausea, with some evidence that it is better than placebo in morning sickness and sea-sickness though not necessarily in IBS. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3580135/\">Iberogast</a> is a combination of nine herbs and plant extracts, and appears to be effective in treating symptoms of indigestion and IBS with minimal side-effects.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 9 June 2015 to correct the spelling of Ayurvedic medicine.<br></p>", "wordcount": "969"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}, {"id": "global-development-professionals-network/2015/feb/11/open-data-how-mobile-phones-saved-bananas-from-bacterial-wilt-in-uganda", "type": "article", "sectionId": "working-in-development", "sectionName": "Working in development", "webPublicationDate": "2015-02-11T16:31:12Z", "webTitle": "Open data: how mobile phones saved bananas from bacterial wilt in Uganda", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/feb/11/open-data-how-mobile-phones-saved-bananas-from-bacterial-wilt-in-uganda", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/feb/11/open-data-how-mobile-phones-saved-bananas-from-bacterial-wilt-in-uganda", "fields": {"byline": "Anna Scott", "body": "<p>Bananas are a staple food in Uganda.

It gathers data from via SMS polls and publishes the results as open sourced, open datasets. </p> <p>The results are sent back to community members via SMS along with treatment options and advice on how best to protect their crops. Within five days of the first SMS being sent out, 190,000 Ugandans had learned about the disease and knew how to save bananas on their farms. </p> <p>Via the Ureport platform, the datasets can also be accessed in real-time by community members, NGOs and the Ugandan government, allowing them to target treatments to where they we needed most. They are also broadcast on radio shows and analysed in articles produced by Ureport, informing wider audiences of scope and nature of the disease and how best to avoid it.<br></p> <p>Such initiatives are inexpensive to run and depend on little to work well: minimal technology, the commitment to publishing data openly and an engaged community.</p> <p>Keeping BBW at bay is still a challenge in Uganda, with <a href=\"http://www.irinnews.org/report/95627/uganda-urgent-funding-needed-to-stem-devastating-banana-wilt\">awareness-raising and support from policymakers crucial to ongoing progress</a>.

Even though garden gurus such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/montydon\">Monty Don</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahraven\">Sarah Raven</a> are big fans, a lot of us still think of dahlias as old-fashioned and a bit of a fiddle.</p> <p>Not so, insists Nick Gilbert \u2013 and he should know: he grows some 400 varieties, arranged alphabetically as a kind of living dahlia dictionary, in a field near Romsey in Hampshire. \u201cYou truly don\u2019t need to fuss,\u201d Gilbert says. \u201cDahlias will grow in any soil, and the only thing they really need is sunshine.\u201d</p> <p>And now is the perfect time to order dahlias for planting, ready for a display that will stretch from July to summer\u2019s last gasp. And there\u2019s no shortage of choice. Come August, you could probably see <a href=\"http://www.gilbertsdahlias.co.uk/\">Gilbert\u2019s dahlia field</a> from space \u2013 a one-and-a-half acre blob of sizzling colour. The colour range is vast and the variety of forms bewildering: flowers shaped like stars, orchids, waterlilies and anemones; cactus forms of various degrees of shagginess; spirograph tennis balls and collerette types, with complex layers of petals; there are even dahlias you could grow for the beauty of their leaves alone \u2013 the delicately ferny <em>Dahlia coccinea</em>, say, or the glossy, pewter-leaved <em>D. </em>\u2018Magenta Star\u2019.</p> <p>While most dahlias grow to 3-4ft, there are also 2ft dwarf varieties and beefy six-footers, and for every dayglow monster sitting stiffly on its stalk like a child\u2019s windmill, there are half a dozen graceful plants that will integrate successfully into the most naturalistic border. The single and collerette forms offer a munificent late food source for a wide variety of pollinators. No wonder Gilbert\u2019s dahlia field, which is managed without chemicals, hums with bees well into November.</p> <p>Dahlias can be planted out only once the risk of frost is over. Pot the tubers up into large pots (two to three litres is fine) with good-quality multipurpose compost, so the stump is just visible above the surface. Put on a sunny windowsill or in a greenhouse or potting shed, keep the compost just moist and plant out in borders or large containers once the risk of frost has passed.</p> <p>After that, there\u2019s not much to worry about, Gilbert says. \u201cIt\u2019s a good idea to stake them, and they\u2019ll flower better if you feed them ... a handful of fish, blood and bone three times over the season is plenty ... but the only thing you absolutely have to do is deadhead. In other words, keep picking them.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"65a38efb72c91c687a8706cbbfb6fa4d452f12ff\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/20/1426858141060/0ebe03bd-a2e6-4b6c-bd6b-7fb0a6d887f3-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Nick Gilbert\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nick Gilbert tends D. \u2018Chimborazo\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Cuttle</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And what to do at the end of the growing season? \u201cIf your soil is light and free-draining, leave the tubers in the ground over winter, as we do here,\u201d Gilbert says. If not, dig them up three weeks after a blackening frost, hose to get rid of the muck in the crevices and cut off stems level with the tubers. Pack the clean, dry tubers in a polystyrene box (the kind greengrocers use for watercress), and check them now and again: if they look shrivelled, give them a light misting to firm them up. Plant into pots mid-March and start watering.</p> <p>Or don\u2019t bother, advises Gilbert. \u201cAfter all, most people will happily spend \u00a320 or \u00a330 on bedding plants and throw them away at the end of the season. That will buy you a lot of dahlias, which will also give you months of colour.\u201d So treat your dahlias as annuals, and if they survive the winter, it\u2019s a bonus.

For many viewers, these adverts will stir thoughts of sunnier times and warmer climes in the summer months ahead, but they have made me dust off last year\u2019s holiday snaps - from a trip to the mountains of north-east Turkey. And what an inspiration these have been for my developing design ideas here in the walled garden that I am in the process of restoring.</p> <p>I was lucky enough to help lead a nature tour into the Pontus Alps and elevated plains of Eastern Anatolia with Bob Gibbons, on his very first sortie into Turkish heartland, back in July. In a fortnight, our <a href=\"http://www.naturalhistorytravel.co.uk/\">tour</a> was able to cherry-pick the very best that this country has to offer: the paying punters were not alone in being overwhelmed by flowery spectacle, for I too was gobsmacked by the exuberant beauty of the places that we were honoured to visit. And yet, while the guests were clicking digital memories, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gardening-blog/2014/mar/10/flete-walled-garden-restoration\">Flete</a>, my garden back in Devon.

Bold-leaved butterburs and groundsels grew amongst vast swathes of ferns and the handsomely-foliaged <em>Rubus caucasica</em>, something akin to plantings by our Victorian forebears. In some cases the schemes were so very simple: grand sweeps of the shuttlecock fern (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matteuccia_struthiopteris\"><em>Matteucia struthiopteris</em></a>) under the lofty canopy of coppiced multi-stemmed alders on steep wet slopes. Elsewhere, these grand plant assemblages included bold patches of colour provided by gigantic forms of familiar herbaceous friends: flat-topped heads of creamy-white <em>Achillea grandiflora</em>, massive clumps of soft blue <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campanula_lactiflora\"><em>Campanula</em> <em>lactiflora</em></a> and vast platter-like heads of the hogweeds <em>Heracleum trachyloma</em> and <em>H. platytaenia</em> (not ones to introduce into gardens).</p> <p> Yet it was on the open steppes close to the Georgian border that a simple blend of feathergrass (an unidentified <em>Stipa</em> species), inky blue-black <em>Salvia nemorosa</em> (reminiscent of <em>S.</em> \u2018Mainacht\u2019), and a fresh lemon small scabious (<a href=\"http://www.shootgardening.co.uk/plant/scabiosa-columbaria-subsp-ochroleuca\"><em>Scabiosa columbaria</em> ssp. <em>ochroleuca</em></a>) really bowled me over, combining stunning colour with clever placing of plants. These three dominants were neither so uniformly mixed as the frankly hideous annual flower meadows that are springing up on our municipal parks and road verges, nor so relatively clumpy as the naturalistic plantings of the New Perennial Movement. The scabious and feathergrass provided the most magically light and airy foil to the clumps of salvia, the whole effect punctuated by more isolated individual clumps of other plants.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know whether feathergrasses will survive the winter-wet here in Devon, nor whether geraniums and inulas will grow in grassy meadows and tolerate an annual close shave of the scythe. Nor do I know whether or not these magnificent swathes of intense floweriness can be effectively recreated at the garden scale.

We have seven to eight months without rain, followed by torrential downpours pounding our parched landscapes. Climate change may make things worse, but the pursuit of charcoal and firewood, and the wholesale destruction of indigenous forests in favour of maize, has left the country vulnerable. </p> <p>Forests regulate water flow and protect topsoil. Restore the forests and you will go a long way to preventing flooding. Design the forests along holistic permaculture principles and you will achieve much more: water harvesting, fuel wood, high-quality timber, indigenous forest restoration and highly diverse food production. In a country where <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/malawi/children.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">almost half the children under five are malnourished</a> and chronic hunger is common, any holistic solution must consider food sovereignty. </p> <p>One solution is forest gardening, an approach to food production based on the fact that forests are resilient and highly productive systems that has existed for thousands of years. Natural forests do not need pesticides or chemicals to ensure their yields, but rather exist in a constant flow of production and recycling. Permaculture has adopted this concept to create \u201c<a href=\"http://www.permaculture.co.uk/videos/2000-year-old-food-forest\" rel=\"nofollow\">food forests</a>\u201d, systems designed along the same principles as natural forests but with more of a focus on multipurpose plants and animals of direct benefit to humans.</p> <p>A natural forest consists of roughly seven layers: the rhizosphere, ground covers, herbaceous layer, shrub layer, climbers, lower canopy and climax layer. While the species in a natural forest might not be of direct use to humans, in a food forest they are. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0c6991d81266bb91160a6c33de3a041b69276237\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/16/1429204203357/8deb86a7-9d91-4a72-ae70-fa9f78fc91bd-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"Amai Kauswe standing in her food forest\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amayi Kauswe standing in her food forest in Kasankha in Mangochi district of southern Malawi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Iga Gozdowska/African Moringa and Permaculture Project</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Imagine a dense forest of mango trees, acacias, citrus trees, coconut palms, guavas, moringas, towering tamarinds and mahoganies. Climbing up many of these trees are passion fruit, air potato, loofa and shushu. Pigeon pea, cassava, the purple flowering tephrosia, hibiscus, amaranth and the big yellow flowers of cassia alata, occupy the shrub and herbaceous layers. Turmeric, arrow root and ginger grow in abundance. Aloe vera grows here and there and cow pea, sweet potato and watermelon crawl along the forest floor or edge. The ground is strewn with a thick layer of decomposing leaves which serve to build rich, healthy soils and maintain the link with microorganisms. A mass of flowering species create excellent environments for bees and other beneficial insects. The system is self-replicating, has great commercial value and is highly beneficial to the health of all creatures that interact with it. </p> <p>Such forests can flourish in Malawi, and I believe it is our duty to provide these beautiful and plentiful systems for future generations. Indeed there are a number of successful examples of similar systems here already. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.lukwe.com/organic_gardens.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lukwe in Livingstonia</a> is one of the best examples of well-established passive water harvesting systems in Malawi.

We work with communities in Mangochi district, southern Malawi to create resilient and diverse food systems using permaculture to help rural Malawians overcome hunger, malnutrition and poverty. This year our focus has chiefly been on creating food forests on land owned by motivated community members in and around several villages. </p> <p>Within these systems one of our dominant species is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moringa\" rel=\"nofollow\">Moringa</a>, a highly nutritious, fast growing and hardy tree, particularly useful for avoiding malnutrition. This year we will be branching out into household rabbit and poultry farming, while developing other income generating activities; primarily irrigated commercial fruit and vegetable production, as well as agro-forestry systems in village maize fields.</p> <p>The diversity and quasi-natural quality of food forests guarantees the good health of those dependent upon them; eat a wide variety of fresh forest produce all year and you are unlikely to suffer from malnutrition. If we create such systems throughout Malawi with the people who need them most, we will go a long way towards eradicating malnutrition and food sovereignty issues while reducing flooding and providing many other benefits. </p> <p>So why, if permaculture designed food forests are so fantastic, and the concept of forest gardening has been around for millennia, have they not been adopted by the mainstream? </p> <p>Permaculture is not primarily a money-making venture and does not appeal to any self-serving agenda. It is based on <a href=\"http://permacultureprinciples.com/principles/\" rel=\"nofollow\">ethics of sharing, caring for one another and cherishing our environment</a>. These are excellent values to form the basis of any society but have often led to permaculture being dismissed as a marginal hippy movement, rather than a serious approach to development. </p> <p>A further challenge is that of changing the mindset of the general population. Inappropriate land management practices, leading to environmental degradation, are deeply ingrained in the way people behave and changing this behaviour represents a serious obstacle. </p> <p>As does a culture of donor dependency; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/jan/14/malawi-aid-freeze-health-education\">40% of the national budget is foreign aid</a>. Such an environment can create a culture of disinterest unless monetary handouts are involved.

I have the privilege of working closely with several outstanding such individuals and believe that such people should be given all possible support if permaculture is to succeed; they are the future leaders of the movement.</p> <p>If we are to fully support these exceptional individuals then more unity is needed in our efforts. Permaculture designers and organisations are often scattered, doing great work with limited means in our own areas but not working together as a unified force. The scope for permaculture advocacy in Malawi is growing fast. When the development sector and the Malawi government reaches out to the permaculture community, it must be met by a coherent and pragmatic force for change.</p> <p>A clear-cut government mandate to scale up the work of permaculture designers to create food forests and water-harvesting systems, particularly in the highlands, would radically change the face of this country. As well as fixing so many problems, it would make Malawi a cutting-edge African nation, embracing genuinely sustainable solutions that are both innovative and traditional. </p> <p><em>Pierre Moorsom is the director of the <a href=\"http://www.ampp.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">African Moringa and Permaculture Project</a>.

That\u2019s where my love of gardening started, but I was inspired by my grandfather who grew beans and beautifully smelling but over-watered Grosse Lisse tomatoes. I cultivated carnivorous plants like venus fly traps, and a few shrubs. The conditions were so dry and dusty I moved them into a greenhouse, which I got Dad to help me build when I was 12. Then I started on vegetables and lettuces. My interest was in nature and in learning \u2013 how to control and encourage growth.</p> <p>Then my parents got divorced and my mother moved to an apartment in the centre of Newcastle and I moved in with her, so couldn\u2019t continue with my greenhouse, or chickens. There was a long gap before I returned to my first passion.</p> <p>I\u2019d moved from Australia to London in 2000 and during my third year of working at the Ledbury I was living in a flat in Maida Vale. It had a flat roof, so I decided to cover it in herbs planted in wine boxes and champagne buckets. I loved being up there at night. Then I moved into a house in East Sheen with my wife five years ago and in a couple of months turned a barren garden into a place to grow strawberries, jerusalem artichokes, potatoes, beans, fennel and types of radishes \u2013 cherry bell, scarlet, little white icicle ones. I soon realised how important positioning is in England, compared to Australia. Here you\u2019ve got to work so much harder. But that\u2019s fine, mate. There\u2019s even more satisfaction, thinking: \u201cI grew this, I looked after this, it\u2019s got no chemical in it and it\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p> <p>I started taking produce to work and did dishes with my own vegetables and herbs on taster menus. I don\u2019t tell customers I grow these things \u2013 unless they specifically ask \u2013 but get great satisfaction from it. I consider my gardening as down-time and a way to relax. I can switch off in the garden at night \u2013 I become calm just by spending 15 minutes watering or picking herbs after getting home at 1.30 or 2.00am.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>My only frustration is when I don\u2019t have enough time and feel like I\u2019m letting down my celeriac</p> <footer> <cite>Brett Graham</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Any half a day it\u2019s possible to have off work, I\u2019m in the garden. We don\u2019t have children and my wife\u2019s only into flowers really, so I\u2019m on my own, in silence. I put boxes on the shed roof because she didn\u2019t want me taking up any more space. I try to put things together that have a similar growing feel, like my wasabi and succulent wah suruna , which need damp, shade and warmth. My only frustration is when I don\u2019t have enough time and feel like I\u2019m letting down my celeriac or whatever. So I\u2019m usually up and in the garden at 6am, before heading to work for an 8am start, taking in sorrel fresh each morning, which is a huge benefit in the Ledbury kitchen. And things like my Japanese spinach work really well for us, because suppliers charge \u00a315 or \u00a316 a kilo and I\u2019m providing 200 grams a day. But I could never produce enough food here for the Ledbury. I can do months of work growing some new potatoes \u2013 picking them, looking after them, sieving through all the dirt, potting and re-potting, and then 25 portions are sold on a lunch menu and they\u2019re all gone in two hours. It\u2019s more about the spirit, the belief in freshness \u2013 it\u2019s a revolution. It\u2019s about teaching the other chefs to source locally and think and feel a certain way, and about the huge rush you get from serving meals with one or two ingredients which you\u2019ve cared for all the way from seed to table.</p> <h2><strong>Bruno Loubet</strong></h2> <p><strong><br></strong>Head chef, Grain Store in King\u2019s Cross, and Grain Store Unleashed.

I hired a machine to take out the grass and dig everything over, used a lot of farm manure, turned it many times in the winter, built the chicken and rabbit pens and then in spring started seeding things in boxes, so everything you see growing here\u2019s from seeds. I\u2019ve worked really hard to make it happen, in between commuting by train to work 14-hour days in London.</p> <p>It all goes back to growing up in rural France where \u2012 as a perk of being a railway station worker \u2012 Dad had an allotment a few minutes\u2019 walk away, which fed our family of 11. Having seven children, maybe it allowed him peace too, although I\u2019d often turn up there. For me, gardening allows the mind to reset, makes me feel sane and human and gives me a connection to food and life.</p> <p>Back in Dad\u2019s allotment we\u2019d grow everything, including many fruits. I remember mates pestering me to go and play football or ride bicycles, saying, \u201cWhy do you want to be gardening, what\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d and I\u2019d reply, \u201cGet off, it\u2019s what I do.\u201d I foraged all the time too \u2012 it\u2019s the way my family lived. Almost everything we ate was linked to its season and proximity.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>I remember in 1968 how my mother, expecting a revolution in France, got us to store food under the floorboards</p> <footer> <cite>Bruno Loubet</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Food had been scarce in the 40s, so my parents remained frugal and adaptable. Mum\u2019s eccentric father, who\u2019d lost his leg after falling from a cherry tree while picking, ripped up the floorboards and planted pumpkins and butternut squash in the house, so no one could steal his food. And I remember in 1968 how my mother, expecting a revolution in France, got us to store food under the floorboards. At eight, Dad taught me how to kill a rabbit, gut, prepare and then cook it. At 11, I used to pick small leeks, no bigger than my finger now, and tie them in bundles then, on the way to school, sell them for two francs a bunch to a guy at the market who\u2019d sell them on.</p> <p>Dad always insisted Mum put a big bowl of mixed leaves on the table. I think if she didn\u2019t he would have divorced her. This is my first place in England where I can step from my kitchen and pick a whole range of food I\u2019m growing myself. The only sounds are the birds, the chickens and the wind through the veg. Once my wife let the dog in and he rolled in my strawberries and flattened a bunch of courgettes. He knew what he\u2019d done because when I got home he hid very quickly.</p> <p>I\u2019m already thinking about winter. Dad\u2019s dead but if he could see this now he\u2019d probably say, \u201cIt\u2019s good, Bruno\u201d, then add: \u201cI\u2019m sure it will be better next year.\u201d My neighbour over the back fence has been growing for 20 years and can\u2019t believe what I\u2019ve got already. Herbs, garlic, spring onions, shallots, [Basque] tear peas, baby leeks, fennel, purple heritage carrots, cabbages, runner beans, a range of beetroots, amaranth, Russian kale, American spaghetti squash, courgettes, artichokes, Japanese radishes. One of those leeks will make a winter soup and I\u2019ve got 30 growing. Not much is ending up at [my restaurant] Grain Store, but, because there\u2019s enough for the family, I\u2019ll take in things for the chefs to test and courgettes for the Italian guys to barbecue for their girlfriends. When I have something <em>really</em> special \u2012 like my little radishes, so fresh and crunchy, the perfect radishes really \u2012 I\u2019ll give them to customers free, as a nibble bowl, and say: \u201cThat\u2019s from my back garden.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Thomasina Miers</strong></h2> <p><strong><br></strong>Founder of Wahaca and food writer.

To a child, digging up potatoes is like mining jewels from black earth. They\u2019ve got their own little gardening kits and boxes \u2013 forks, watering can, garden bags to carry, the lot. They want to copy, so they\u2019re great at watering, digging, weeding and putting earth over after I seed. They\u2019ll take out bowls for raspberry and strawberry picking and, of course, they\u2019re brilliant at eating them.</p> <p>I\u2019d grown up eating vegetables from gardens \u2013 not at home but with grandparents. One set lived in Gloucestershire and that grandpa would endlessly get us to eat his beans, stewed gooseberries and rhubarb \u2013 he kind of forced it down our throats a bit. There were also grandparents in Wales that us kids got sent to whenever Mum and Dad went off on holiday alone. I did a lot of picking in Gran\u2019s small kitchen garden, which had loads of runner beans and globe artichokes. She\u2019d also take us to pick-your-own farms and awarded tiny amounts of pocket money, on a points system, for gardening.</p> <p>I\u2019d never had a garden of my own until getting this house with my husband. We had a bit of tangle though. He said, \u201cWhat if I have a son who wants to play football?\u201d I\u2019d wanted vegetables everywhere but ended up with raised beds on either side. And we kept some roses for the bees and jasmine and lavender for the smells. The garden\u2019s been going three years now and provides me with loads of ingredients. Shiso, mustard leaf, rocket, chillies, beans, sorrel... loads and loads of herbs. And, my God, the garlic. I\u2019ve still got a large jar of garlic puree I boiled down from some wild garlic we dug up in June.</p> <p>The most totally inspiring garden I ever saw was Diana Kennedy\u2019s.

I lived with my family in a house in Highbury. Mum was a high-flying solicitor and Dad did computer-auditing and they had no interest in the garden. Meals involved a lot of tinned and frozen stuff \u2012 it was very much a cupboard of convenience. But, fascinated by my grandmother\u2019s love of home cooking in Barry, I started cooking for my parents. At nine or 10 years old I was making a starter and main course each evening for when they got home. I\u2019d serve them, then go to bed, to let them enjoy it. They didn\u2019t appreciate it to the extent they could have done, frankly. Mine wasn\u2019t the warmest upbringing. But after they got divorced I took on the renovation of the house and then built a conservatory on the back and filled it with a complete range of unusual and rare herbs.</p> <p>When I began working with Simon Rogan at L\u2019Enclume there was a local farm supplying it with produce who we pushed for more volume but [who] weren\u2019t very interested. So we started our own farm from scratch in six acres of empty field, in a beautiful landscape, down the road from the restaurant. We still call it \u2018Our Farm\u2019 and it supplies all Simon\u2019s restaurants by refrigerated van.</p> <p>I worked incredibly hard on the farm, starting early 2011, and in spring I was going back and forth to L\u2019Enclume and standing at the bar and watching people serve food I\u2019d seeded, grown, prepared in the kitchen and plated. Having control of your restaurant produce, that\u2019s the main thing. And growing varieties you can\u2019t necessarily get elsewhere.Returning to London to work at Fera was odd, in that there\u2019d been far less bullshit in the countryside, more headspace, more of a natural life. I spent a lot of time finding this house, one of a price I could afford, near enough to work and with the right feeling. Because the tiny back garden gets little light I decided to make the front steps and what is technically the pavement into my growing area. After working closely with our suppliers during the day, I get to come home to a place beside the canal where I\u2019m helping things grow throughout their cycles. It\u2019s difficult to water tomatoes when I\u2019m doing 18-hour days, but it\u2019s got to be done and it\u2019s good to do it. The pavement lamp comes on as soon as it gets dark, and that helps me and the growth. I call it my concrete garden. It\u2019s my escape and it feeds me. There\u2019s incredible flavours here: dittander, meadowsweet, marigolds... The Mexican marigold, for instance, I bought in the seeds from south America, sowed, they grew a treat and we\u2019ve used it in every restaurant since. Today\u2019s my day off and I\u2019ve picked leeks and runner beans to cook tonight for me and my brother, and great cress. I do take a fair bit into Fera, but it\u2019s also about gathering specimens for when I have somewhere bigger to put them.</p> <p>I\u2019m aiming to have my own restaurant right in the middle of a farm \u2012 Devon/Cornwall, but certainly a place of outstanding natural beauty. So many restaurants have gardens but they\u2019re often dead and barren. What I want is a place working totally harmoniously. Restaurant, brewery, dairy and bakery, all in one, with me living there, working with incredible like-minded people and with a growing operation going on all round. The things closest to the building would be interesting herbs, flowers and things needing special care and attention; then in surrounding fields the large scale vegetables and orchards. I haven\u2019t got a name for it yet, but the vision\u2019s there and growing nicely.</p> <p><br></p> <h2><strong>Wai Ting Chung</strong></h2> <p>Co-owner, Bao, London.

They hadn\u2019t had a garden in Hong Kong because there\u2019s just no space there. For two years I lived above our takeaway restaurant The Golden Crown in Beeston. We also had The Oriental Pearl in West Bridgford and Opium, in a listed building with a grand staircase, in the centre of Nottingham. It was very traditional Cantonese food. So I grew up, from 14 at least, helping or working in restaurants.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>My interest in gardening began, ironically, after moving to London, where there seemed so little space to do it</p> <footer> <cite>Wai Ting Chung</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The first garden we had, lawned and hedged, was behind our new-build house in Wilford, where my family dug out a patch and began growing Chinese vegetables like spinach and gai lan [broccoli]. For them it was never about aesthetics and they weren\u2019t particularly green-fingered. It was their way of supplementing produce for the restaurants. Personally I had no interest in it \u2012 I was into algebra and art, then fashion. My interest in gardening began, ironically, after moving to London, where there seemed so little space to do it.</p> <p>An ex-boyfriend bought me a grow-bag \u2012 that was the start. I had a little back yard in Stoke Newington and was growing vegetables to cook.</p> <p>Four months ago we opened Bao in Soho and it coincided with me getting this flat above The Newman Arms in Fitzrovia. The roof terrace gets sunlight all day. I share the flat and terrace with Matt, who part-owns the pub. We\u2019re growing quite a few things and have this wooden structure to allow drainage. This isn\u2019t about supplying Bao with ingredients, but about growing things for my own kitchen and The Newman Arms\u2019 restaurant.</p> <p>I love it up here. It\u2019s relaxation, and to be surrounded by plants is very appealing, my sanctuary. After pub closing time, it\u2019s surprisingly quiet \u2013 apart from someone who sings on her balcony \u2012 and I sit up here at night, after work, on the AstroTurf, watering the kale, sorrel, basil, pea-shoots and tomato plants.</p> <p>I\u2019m not necessarily very good at gardening and it\u2019s hard work, but I really enjoy it. I\u2019m encouraged by salad-grower Sean O\u2019Neil of The Cornwall Project [which supplies Cornish produce to restaurants], who I\u2019ve been down to see at Keveral Farm in St Martin by Looe. He\u2019s started producing Szechuan peppercorns, which are very difficult to grow in this country. Just the taste of the leaves is incredible and I\u2019d love to get to grips with growing those next.</p>", "wordcount": "2849"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}, {"id": "childrens-books-site/2015/aug/27/helen-maslins-top-10-literary-castles-and-country-houses", "type": "article", "sectionId": "childrens-books-site", "sectionName": "Children's books", "webPublicationDate": "2015-08-27T10:00:01Z", "webTitle": "Helen Maslin's top 10 literary castles and country houses", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/aug/27/helen-maslins-top-10-literary-castles-and-country-houses", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/childrens-books-site/2015/aug/27/helen-maslins-top-10-literary-castles-and-country-houses", "fields": {"byline": "Helen Maslin", "body": "<p>I\u2019ve always loved evocative old castles, abbeys and manors in books.

Brideshead Castle from <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/brideshead-revisited-5.html\">Brideshead Revisited</a> by Evelyn Waugh</strong></h2> <p>Brideshead Revisited was a battered favourite among boys I knew when I was in my teens. Although it was never the theological theme of the book that interested them \u2013 they, like Charles Ryder, had fallen under the spell of Brideshead Castle and the glamorous Flyte family.</p> <p>Charles is already entranced with beautiful and charming Sebastian Flyte, when he\u2019s taken to Brideshead to meet Sebastian\u2019s nanny. He first sees the house on a sunny afternoon in June and admits that although \u201crapt in the vision\u201d he also felt an ominous chill at the words Sebastian used \u2013 not, \u201cthat is my house\u201d, but \u201cit\u2019s where my family live\u201d.</p> <p>Although Brideshead has a shining dome, fireplaces of sculptured marble, frescoed ceilings and startlingly renovated chapel there\u2019s an air of sadness amid all the splendour. Of course, we already know from the prologue that the castle will be taken over and damaged by the army \u2013 and while writing the book, Waugh himself believed that all ancestral seats like Brideshead were doomed to decay. </p> <h2><strong>2. Hampton from <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/love-in-a-cold-climate.html\">Love in a Cold Climate</a> by Nancy Mitford</strong></h2> <p>Hampton is an English country house built in the style of a Gothic French chateau. It is grand and mad and utterly terrifying. Lady Montdore takes few pains to put her guests at ease and poor Cousin Fanny (no stranger to the eccentricities of country house living, having spent her holidays at Alconleigh with the Radletts) finds \u201cthe terror at Hampton was of a different quality, icy and dispassionate, and it reigned downstairs.\u201d</p> <p>Hampton is impossibly splendid and luxurious. There\u2019s the huge French map table, always covered with the latest papers which are rearranged several times a day by a footman. The names and titles of the guests are \u201cwritten in a careful copperplate on a card on the door\u201d. There\u2019s the Long Gallery, always full of fashionables \u201cchattering like starlings in a tree\u201d, and of course, the boiseries, Boulle and bronzes that so delight Cedric.</p> <p>In spite of such splendour, Hampton echoes the cold climate of the title and Polly Hampton confides in Fanny that she \u201cenvies the Radlett children with their upbringing in such a quiet, affectionate household.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7bb106583c7e3561b2ab340d5778abe6ef73d42b\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/26/1440602895512/c40e2601-6992-42dc-8d3d-1e875e1a71c7-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Helen Maslin\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Helen Maslin: \u2018some of these castles and country houses are almost characters in their own right\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sally Burford /PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>3. Blandings Castle from the <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/blandings.html\">Blandings series</a> by PG Wodehouse</strong></h2> <p>Another writer every bit as popular with male readers as female, Wodehouse recorded a privileged and golden world that never really existed. Blandings Castle stands at its heart. It\u2019s described as one of the oldest and largest stately homes in England, with its \u201csmooth green lawns, rolling parkland, majestic trees, well-bred bees and gentlemanly birds\u201d. Not forgetting the infamous moss-carpeted Yew alley and the exceptional rose garden. The sun of course, is always shining.</p> <p> Blandings is the seat of the ninth Earl of Emsworth \u2013 although he has to share it with his sister, his children, an assortment of servants and other bars to his happiness. Upon meeting his son, Freddie, in London, he declares \u201cAnd why anybody but an imbecile should want to come to London when he could be at Blandings!\u201d</p> <p>Life at the castle is far from peaceful. His Lordship\u2019s children form disastrous attachments, jewel thieves abound, McAllister and Beach regularly give notice and the Empress goes off her food. Everything always comes right in the end, though, and Lord Emsworth will spend the final page in the library, drinking a restful whisky and soda and reading a Pig book.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf6cd46c7ffc7afa379b772a2445b5562c09fb95\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/27/1440658713516/b0af5cc3-007b-425a-bbf4-bd4a68bf746b-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Carey Mulligan as Isabella Thorpe and Felicity Jones as Catherine Morland, in a still from Andrew Davies's film adaptation of Northanger Abbey.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carey Mulligan as Isabella Thorpe and Felicity Jones as Catherine Morland, in a still from Andrew Davies\u2019s film adaptation of Northanger Abbey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colm Hogan/PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>4. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/northanger-abbey-28.html\">Northanger Abbey</a> by Jane Austen</strong></h2> <p>\u201cNorthanger Abbey! \u2013 These were thrilling words, and wound up Catherine\u2019s feelings to the highest point of ecstasy.\u201d Of all Jane Austen\u2019s famous country houses, Northanger Abbey is irresistible simply because it\u2019s so...disappointing. It is believed by the heroine to be the sort of spooky old ruin that features in Gothic novels \u2013 an Otranto or a Udolpho. </p> <p>During the journey into Gloucestershire, Henry is amused to discover that Catherine imagines his family home will have secret passages, narrow cells and a ruined chapel. Instead, she finds modern lodges, elegant furniture, wide-paned windows and an army of well-trained servants. In her room, a strange bureau contains only a bundle of receipts. A sinister chest contains a counterpane. Finally \u2013 after making the mistake of suspecting Henry\u2019s father of murder \u2013 Catherine reaches the conclusion that \u201cCharming as were all Mrs Radcliffe\u2019s works, and charming even as were the works of all her imitators, it was not in them perhaps that human nature, at least in the midland counties of England, was to be looked for!\u201d</p> <h2><strong>5.

Mrs Wilkins wants to escape from her husband and the English rain; Mrs Arbuthnot wants to escape from her life of duty and virtue; Lady Caroline wants to escape from men \u201cwho grab\u201d and fashionable society; Mrs Fisher wants to escape her loneliness.</p> <p>San Salvatore acts upon each of them as a sort of castle-shaped fairy godmother. Its rooms are white-walled and filled with sunlight. Outside, there\u2019s the wisteria, of course, \u201ctumbling over itself in its excess of life\u201d. There are cool lilies underfoot, there are armfuls of freesias with a scent that comes in through the door and <em>floats</em>, and there\u2019s a great cypress like a sword. Olive groves and fig- trees and peach trees and cherry-trees \u2013 all showering blossom. \u201cColour seemed flung down anyhow, anywhere; every sort of colour, piled up in heaps, pouring along in rivers \u2013 the periwinkles looked exactly as if they were being poured down each side of the steps...\u201d</p> <p>Under the spell of so much beauty, the four women begin to hope again \u2013 to fall in love \u2013 to be happy.</p> <h2><strong>6. Manderley from <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/308475/\">Rebecca</a> by Daphne du Maurier</strong></h2> <p>Manderley is the beautiful ancestral home of Maxim de Winter, who brings his young bride home after a courtship of only a few weeks. She knows very little about him \u2013 or his way of life \u2013 and suffers agonies of shyness. Before long, she has convinced herself that her husband is still in love with his first wife, and begins to compare herself with Rebecca in every way.</p> <p> Manderley haunts her as much as Rebecca does. As Maxim explains \u201cHalf the stuff you see here in the rooms was never here originally. The drawing-room as it is today, the morning room \u2013 that\u2019s all Rebecca. Those chairs that Frith points out so proudly to visitors on the public day, and that panel of tapestry \u2013 Rebecca again. Oh, some of the things were here admittedly, stored away in back rooms, my father knew nothing about furniture or pictures, but the majority was bought by Rebecca. The beauty of Manderley that you see today, the Manderley that people talk about and photograph and paint, it\u2019s all due to her, to Rebecca.\u201d</p> <p>Although it\u2019s impossible not to sympathise with the unnamed narrator, it was Rebecca who my 13-year old self really fell in love with. Rebecca and Manderley \u2013 with its shrouded west wing, full of furs and sequinned dresses. Its morning room decorated with valuable ornaments and flowers and beautiful writing table.

Hogwarts Castle from the <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/harry-potter-and-the-philosopher-s-stone.html\">Harry Potter series</a> by JK Rowling</strong></h2> <p>Well, there\u2019s no way I\u2019m leaving Hogwarts off the list this close to JK\u2019s 50th! The School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is loved by boys and girls, adults and children alike. It\u2019s the school where Harry Potter learns enough magic to duel with Voldemort and avenge his parents.</p> <p>In appearance, Hogwarts resembles the huge, spooky castle that features in many gothic novels, and there\u2019s certainly plenty of danger. The forbidden forest is crawling with giant spiders, armed centaurs and Hippogriffs. The hothouses are full of murderous plants like Mandrakes and Devil\u2019s Snare \u2013 plus there\u2019s a willow tree that tries to beat people to death. There\u2019s a basilisk in the basement and a three-headed dog in the corridor on the third floor. </p> <p>But apart from that, it\u2019s a traditional, old-fashioned boarding school and many of the pupils regard it as home. In second book, Harry \u201cmissed Hogwarts so much it was like having a constant stomach ache.\u201d And when Voldemort returns to Hogwarts in The Deathly Hallows, it is a home-coming for him too. \u201cHe walked on, around the edge of the lake, taking in the outlines of the beloved castle, his first kingdom, his birthright...\u201d</p> <p>Although when Voldemort attempts to claim that \u201cbirthright\u201d, the entire school fights back! </p> <h2><strong>8. Thornfield Hall from <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/jane-eyre-47.html\">Jane Eyre</a> by Charlotte Bront\u00eb</strong></h2> <p>Thornfield is a typical gothic mansion, as remote and gloomy as its owner. But having already survived the abuse of Gateshead and the cruelty and privation of Lowood, Jane Eyre is undaunted. She takes up the position of governess to Mr Rochester\u2019s young ward and is shown around the Hall, finding \u201call was well-arranged and handsome\u201d, although she admits to some qualms about the third floor. Here, the rooms and corridors are dark and gloomy and filled with all the oldest furniture. The housekeeper, Mrs Fairfax, says \u201cOne would almost say that, if there were a ghost at Thornfield Hall, this would be its haunt.\u201d</p> <p>From the third floor, comes mad and mirthless laughter. There is an unexplained fire in the night. Later, Jane hears a scream and the sounds of a struggle and finds an injured man, oozing blood. After he has been secretly despatched in a chaise, Rochester is unable to face re-entering the house: \u201cCome where there is some freshness, for a few moments,\u201d he said, \u201cthat house is a mere dungeon; don\u2019t you see it so?\u201d</p> <p>When Jane returns after a year\u2019s absence, she finds that Thornfield has suffered the fate of so many mansions in gothic novels. It\u2019s a blackened ruin.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c369d00ca7b5685d58c4934f3a98e3f98457b4d7\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/27/1440657698053/34ff8bc2-2955-4e78-878b-d306f4a33cb2-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Slains Castle near Cruden Bay, Aberdeenshire, Scotland is said to be the inspiration for Bram Stoker's Dracula.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Slains Castle near Cruden Bay, Aberdeenshire, Scotland is said to be the inspiration for Bram Stoker\u2019s Dracula. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>9. Castle Dracula from <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/dracula-47.html\">Dracula</a> by Bram Stoker</strong></h2> <p>Easily the spookiest place on this list is Castle Dracula. \u201cA vast ruined castle, from whose tall black windows came no ray of light, and whose broken battlements showed a jagged line against the moonlit sky.\u201d</p> <p>Young solicitor, Jonathan Harker, is sent to the Transylvanian home of Count Dracula on business. He travels through wild, snowy country swarming with wolves, as the locals cross themselves and try to deter him. Upon reaching the castle, finds it worn and dilapidated, but still an impenetrable stronghold. Harker soon realises he has no way of escape.</p> <p>The interior of the castle is decorated with costly furnishings, cups and plates of gold, and there is a good library. No servants however \u2013 and no mirrors. The castle is seething with menace and Harker becomes increasingly desperate to leave. Eventually, he climbs out of the window to discover a ruined chapel containing fifty great wooden boxes filled with earth. In one, lays Dracula. \u201cI saw the dead eyes, and in them, dead though they were, such a look of hate, though unconscious of me or my presence that I fled from the place...\u201d</p> <h2><strong>10.

Glyphosate is used liberally in the streets and parks of many towns and cities to control grass and weeds, but was classified last month by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), an arm of the World Health Organisation (WHO), as \u201c<a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045%2815%2970134-8/abstract\">probably carcinogenic to humans</a>\u201d. </p> <p>If the document handover sounds like a spy novel, it is undeniably the case that anti-pesticide campaigners must often collate detailed, almost obsessive knowledge before they are taken seriously.

For 10 years, Wilson has been asking Newcastle City Council to stop using glyphosate herbicides. He worries it is harmful to the local ecosystem, as it vaporises or enters water courses, and dangerous for the people of Newcastle, too. \u201cThis is the time of year when we should be savouring the greenery that surrounds us, not zapping it with toxic chemicals,\u201d says Wilson, who claims that repeatedly sprayed patches take more than five years to recover.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0280c4aafe0145999386939e3e13897c03b1ad7f\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/20/1429533945998/654c2109-d3d4-40da-bad1-34702d19fc3f-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Monsanto's Roundup weedkiller\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Monsanto\u2019s Roundup weedkiller, which contains glyphosate.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Studioshots/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are many John Wilsons waging war with their town or city halls on this issue: Karoline Spence in Austin, Christopher Brown in New York, Kermit Myers in Greensboro and Christina Rock in Cape Town are just some of those who, like Wilson, are protesting the use of glyphosates through online petitions.

And in New York, an environmental group is suing the Environmental Protection Agency for ignoring the dangers of glyphosate which, it claims, has <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/nrdc-sues-epa-over-demise-monarch-butterfly-population-n314371\">resulted in the demise of the monarch butterfly population</a>. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.monsanto.com/glyphosate/pages/glyphosate-frequently-asked-questions.aspx\">Defenders of glyphosate say<strong> </strong>it is biologically degraded over time</a> by soil microorganisms into materials that are naturally occurring, including carbon dioxide and phosphate.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>But in 2013, <a href=\"https://www.foeeurope.org/glyphosate-reasons-for-concern-briefing-130613\">Friends of the Earth Europe commissioned an independent laboratory</a> in Germany to test urine samples from people in 18 countries for glyphosate.

In 1969, it was re-patented as a herbicide by biotech giant Monsanto.

Co-ordinator Dr Medardo \u00c1vila-V\u00e1zquez, a paediatrician at the National University of C\u00f3rdoba, published a report in February suggesting 30% of deaths in the most intensive agricultural areas of the country are from cancer, compared to a national average of 20%. He also noted that cancer death rates had increased since 2000. \u201cSignificantly, the date coincides with the expansion in the use of glyphosate and other agrochemicals massively applied in those areas,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.i-sis.org.uk/Devastating_Impacts_of_Glyphosate_Argentina.php\">he wrote</a>. <br></p> <p>Is glyphosate to blame? Is it really carcinogenic? No one can say with certainty. Because long-term human feeding trials would be unethical, the evidence has been mainly limited to studies of agricultural exposures. But other evidence, including from animal studies, led the IARC to its \u201cprobably carcinogenic\u201d classification. Glyphosate has been linked to tumours in mice and rats \u2013 and there is also what the IARC classifies as \u201cmechanistic evidence\u201d, such as DNA damage to human cells from exposure to glyphosate.</p> <p>The totality of the evidence has been enough to convince some cities, including Chicago and Paris, to make their public spaces glyphosate-free. The City of Vancouver has gone a step further, banning the public and private use of herbicides including glyphosate, aside from the treatment of invasive weeds like Japanese knotweed.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7cb31fd463f96ec2361b41e18a86cda3eb1c9235\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/20/1429534581606/f31abf80-c784-4d7f-831b-15cac78e0918-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Vivienne Westwood (pictured) supports EU proposals to suspend the use of what she considers to be bee-killing pesticides\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vivienne Westwood (pictured) joined Katharine Hamnett and other fashion designers in 2013 to support EU proposals to suspend the use of what they consider to be bee-killing pesticides.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Alternatives to glyphosates include more hand-weeding and strimming to the use of hot foam and even electrocution.

Kids\u2019 shows repeat things \u2013 \u201cAgain, again!\u201d cry the Teletubbies \u2013 because that\u2019s how kids learn. And CBeebies is all about learning. Its remit, as described in the channel\u2019s service licence, is \u201cto offer high-quality, mostly UK-produced programmes to educate and entertain the BBC\u2019s youngest audience\u201d. Note that education comes first. As for the chirpiness: the characters smile relentlessly because that is nice for the watching child. It is only the cynical adult sitting next to them who notices the slow death taking place behind an actor\u2019s eyes, the disappearing dream of a part in Game of Thrones, the sense \u2013 crystallised in that ferocious grin \u2013 of some profound psychic break taking place.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If a show is on CBeebies, it\u2019s legit. It is like seeing the Fair Trade symbol on a punnet of strawberries</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In all this, Me Too! is entirely innocent. It is not the show\u2019s fault that it inhabits the CBeebies equivalent of the graveyard slot. Nor is it unusual in having an atmosphere of unflagging glee. You don\u2019t watch children\u2019s TV for irony. But at the same time it is hard, while watching, to turn off the part of your brain accustomed to tearing things to shreds. The newish parent, who never foresaw the period in their life when they would be spending the hours before dawn watching a woman named Bobby mop a bus depot in the middle of the night, finds themselves picking apart plot, character, meaning, production values. You find yourself wondering \u2013 at some length \u2013 how Bobby actually manages if she is looking after her son all day and then going off to clean buses at night. No wonder she is scared of the thunder! She must be knackered.<strong> </strong>CBeebies, you see, has become part of your life.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>When rumours began to circulate last year </strong>that the BBC was threatening to axe CBeebies and move all children\u2019s content online, the uproar was predictable and cacophonous. A <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/bbc-save-the-cbeebies-tv-channel?recruiter=11739590&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=copylink\">petition was mounted on Change.org</a> and signed by over 130,000 fraught parents. Parents\u2019 websites such as Netmums succumbed to panic: \u201cLife without CBeebies? That\u2019s just not even worth thinking about, is it?\u201d Blogs were written: \u201cIn some deep, profound, sleep-deprived way, each of us <em>is</em> CBeebies. Please, BBC, do not take it away\u201d (New Statesman). Not everyone is a fan, though. There is, it seems, a political divide in CBeebies appreciation, judging by a recent Spectator article entitled \u201c<a href=\"http://www.spectator.co.uk/2014/01/agitprop-for-toddlers-the-oddly-strident-politics-of-cbeebies/\">Agitprop for Toddlers</a>\u201d in which the author compared a wildlife programme on the channel, in which \u201ca rainbow nation of children [march] around the British countryside singing \u2018Let\u2019s make sure we recycle every day\u2019\u201d, to \u201cone of those Dear Leader dirges you see in North Korea\u201d.</p> <p>The outcry and ensuing campaign was ultimately victorious \u2013 last September, the BBC\u2019s director general, Tony Hall, confirmed to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/sep/15/bbc-has-no-proposals-to-take-cbeebies-and-cbbc-online-only\">Culture, Media and Sport select committee</a> that he had no intention of scrapping the channel. BBC3, meanwhile, sank without a fight \u2013 not having in its back pocket an army of supporters for whom it represented far more than simply television, but a presence that has embedded itself in their home.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d7baeee5be002c36adda4b4c89c2455b7ed92cd1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d7baeee5be002c36adda4b4c89c2455b7ed92cd1/0_155_1736_1042/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018In the Night Garden exerts a kind of supernatural force that can soften even the most jaded of adult viewers\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018In the Night Garden exerts a kind of supernatural force that can soften even the most jaded of adult viewers\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Ragdoll</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You could, if you wanted, structure your whole day by CBeebies. Its content is divided into sections, or \u201czones\u201d according to the <a href=\"http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/commissioning/site/CBeebies_STYLEGUIDE_150910.pdf\">CBeebies Style Guide</a>, a 34-page document from the BBC commissioning department, intended for programme-makers and channel staff: Get Set Go! between 6am and 9am, Discover and Do, from 9am to 3.30pm, including Lunch Time at 12, Big Fun Time, from 3.30pm to 6pm, and then the Bedtime Hour from 6 to 7pm. \u201cWith zones,\u201d explains the guide, \u201ceveryone knows where they are, including parents\u201d. It is surely the most literal version of the nanny state, telling you when to craft and when to sleep. Though the timetable does not suit everyone: \u201cI DON\u2019T WANT TO FEED THEM LUNCH AT 12 ON THE DOT EVERY DAY!!\u201d declared Ladymoods on the parenting forum Mumsnet, \u201cSTOP TELLING US WHEN TO DO STUFF!!\u201d</p> <p>CBeebies thinks like a toddler: it likes clarity and consistency, the comfort of routine. Its brand is typified by a font that I can only describe as the printed equivalent of jelly (its official name is Melt). The idents that appear between shows are populated by a collection of animated yellow \u201cbugs\u201d that squeak and wobble. \u201cThe bugs have real personalities but they are not characters \u2013 they are the CBeebies brand come to life,\u201d announces the style guide. And then there are the presenters, a tribe of health-exuding young men and women in citrus-coloured T-shirts who are required to offer bite-size entertainment between shows. They chuck balls to each other, play hide and seek, or sometimes, if their imagination fails them, just tell you what\u2019s coming next in a very, very excited voice.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>CBeebies' brand is typified by a font that I can only describe as the printed equivalent of jelly</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The presenters provoke intense online debate. On Mumsnet, there are long threads comparing their skills and physical virtues. The day that long-time presenter Andy wore a rather tight-fitting space suit to present the birthday card segment is still fondly remembered. (\u201cIt was a little <em>snug</em>!\u201d wrote Elsqueak. \u201cWhere to look!\u201d) Once, at London Zoo, I happened to see Andy in the flesh performing in an animal-themed show to a packed tent of toddlers and their parents, and inevitably the grown-ups seemed far more starstruck than the kids who were just as entertained by the guy in a gorilla suit. Every now and then I\u2019d see a mum point at the stage and say to their kid, but really to themselves: \u201cLook! It\u2019s Andy!\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Naturally, CBeebies has spread</strong> far beyond the small screen. There\u2019s an app, a radio version, live shows, and even, since 2014, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/oct/15/bbc-cbeebies-land-alton-towers\">CBeebies Land at Alton Towers</a>. The day we went, it was bitterly cold and there was still a good half-hour wait for the Octonauts rollercoaster and the Postman Pat van ride. The Hey Duggee interactive show was the principal draw, it seemed, for the crowd, who queued patiently with shivering children for a picture with Duggee himself, in this case a human in a massive dog suit. The queue was heavily patrolled, lest Duggee\u2019s time was overly absorbed by his eager fans and he missed his next show. Such is the life of the CBeebies celebrity. Our patience lasted long enough for one ride, the Treetop Adventure, which involved getting in a car and going round a track about 20ft off the ground. Pretty fun. It gave a good aerial view of the place: the fake trees, the sign forbidding adults from entering the photo tent without a child, the costumed staff. Everyone who did not look like they were suffering from frostbite seemed to be having a blast.</p> <p>Since it launched in 2002, the channel has gradually colonised the globe. Its international version, marketed by BBC Worldwide, is now shown in 78 countries \u2013 from Mozambique to South Korea. Recently, it became the first TV channel to be recognised by the Mexican Paediatric Association for its role in the education and development of children. The BBC estimates it is watched by 1.9 million kids under the age of six in Britain alone.</p> <p>The budget is small \u2013 \u00a328.3m for 2016-17 \u2013 because CBeebies only makes around half its programmes. For the rest, it commissions and \u201cpre-buys\u201d shows from independent production companies: this is a more economical way for the channel to get what it wants, because it invests in a show before it is made, puts its cash in alongside other international investors, then gets a show tailored to its audience that it has not had to fully fund.</p> <p>The commissioners have a long history of picking winners, too. Teletubbies, first shown on the BBC in 1997, is probably the most successful children\u2019s TV show of all time. It has aired in 120 countries and been watched by an estimated one billion children, 300 million of them in China, where it was the first western pre-school TV show to be broadcast. And now it\u2019s back \u2013 a revamped version launched on CBeebies last year, in which the reincarnated Teletubbies seem remarkably similar to the old ones, although now with access to a giant smartphone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"de4ffcb1343510e82de1f80459de81c6a3f4391f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de4ffcb1343510e82de1f80459de81c6a3f4391f/0_0_3799_2279/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hey Duggee is also part of the interactive show at CBeebies Land at Alton Towers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hey Duggee is also part of the interactive show at CBeebies Land at Alton Towers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is of course, a downside to such success \u2013 just like Hollywood with its churn of superheroes, there is a certain creative reliance on the back catalogue. Even the Teletubbies\u2019 creator, Anne Wood<strong> </strong>\u2013 the Steven Spielberg of children\u2019s TV \u2013 told the Radio Times she was \u201ca bit sad\u201d about the remake. \u201cIt comes down to the times we\u2019re in: people feel safer remaking hits of the past rather than investing in something new.\u201d</p> <p>Postman Pat\u2019s new image is a classic of its kind, a shiny upgrade that retains reassuring key features, such as Jess the cat. I watched an original from 1981 and almost keeled over at the glacial pace and low-stakes plot. Pat\u2019s main task for the 15-minute episode was finding the lost doll of a little girl named Katie. He stopped in at various locations in the village to conduct his search. At the church with Reverend Timms he found a lost glove under a pew, and then, at Ted\u2019s workshop, Ted \u201cfound a watch he\u2019d forgotten he\u2019d had\u201d. At the episode\u2019s denouement, Pat discovers Katie\u2019s doll behind a box of chocolates \u2013 it was there the whole time!</p> <p>New Pat would laugh in the face of such twists. There is no sign of the balding Reverend Timms, and now Pat has a mobile phone, regular if perplexing use of a helicopter, and is constantly in the grip of some unfolding emergency that is usually the result of a potentially dangerous object falling out of the back of his van \u2013 a hive of bees, for example. In one recent episode, Pat had to perform a near-lethal aerial display in front of the whole town, whizzing underneath a bridge in a supercharged flying machine. So much for the lost doll.</p> <p>Of course, even CBeebies has to move with the times. When a three-year-old can competently locate inappropriate music videos on an iPad, a scheduled TV channel \u2013 an old-fashioned notion in itself \u2013 has to offer up some pretty jazzy stuff to compete. Give Pat gizmos! Get the helicopter out to find the missing package! At least they\u2019ve kept the song: \u201cEarly in the morning / Just when day is dawning / Pat feels he\u2019s a really happy man.\u201d Except there\u2019s something about that \u201cfeels\u201d that makes you question Pat\u2019s sanity. Daily, he loses letters, parcels, bee hives. Pat is fantastically inept at his job. Sure, the guy<strong> </strong><em>feels</em><strong> </strong>happy, but he\u2019s hopeless.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c5bca4c9e74406cf9df21078adeb0f8ce1ffeb52\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5bca4c9e74406cf9df21078adeb0f8ce1ffeb52/124_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The shiny new Postman Pat and his helicopter.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The shiny new Postman Pat and his helicopter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>I don\u2019t know if everyone has the same guilt</strong> about kids and television. I have friends who grew up watching as much as they wanted (loads), and then there are the ones who were strictly rationed, half an hour a day, only Newsround or Blue Peter, never ITV. I was in the latter camp until secondary school when my mum took on some extra teaching work in the evenings and I had blissful, uninterrupted hours ploughing through the Neighbours-Home and Away-Blossom-Wonder Years-My So-Called Life-Party of Five repertoire. But that was later. The early years were heavily policed and television in the morning was indicative of profound systemic breakdown. Now, as I thwack on the TV to buy myself half an hour, or distract the kid while I cut her toenails, I can\u2019t help feeling a sort of internal tug, as though some vital societal fabric is being unravelled because there are images moving across a screen in the living room before lunch.</p> <p>From the first BBC broadcast aimed at children \u2013 Watch with Mother, which aired in July 1950 \u2013 people fretted about the effect that watching television would have on the young, and society as a whole. Some concerns were practical \u2013 according to David Oswell in his book Television, Childhood and the Home, the BBC issued advice to children in 1954 not to watch TV while lying on the floor with their chins cupped in their hands, as this was liable \u201cto make their faces misshapen\u201d. Others were profoundly moral.<strong> </strong>\u201cWhat might our children become?\u201d wrote Monica Dickens in Woman\u2019s Own in 1950, \u201cThey might become a generation who couldn\u2019t read a book, or play games out of doors, or amuse themselves with carpentry or trains or butterflies, or the hundreds of hobbies with which a child potters so happily.\u201d</p> <p>Something of this panic persists today when, for example, a friend comes round and you explain, full of embarrassment, that the television is only being turned on so you can actually have a conversation. There is a sense that you have failed a little, having not come up with some more constructive diversion, such as making a hovercraft out of sticks, or, more fundamentally, not having created a child who will happily do puzzles in absorbed silence for prolonged periods of time.</p> <p>CBeebies seems to know about that guilt, and, with one eye on the parent, seeks to assuage it. So there are songs, interludes between the programmes, to remind the viewing child that a world exists beyond their sofa. \u201cEveryone get out and about / So much to do outside!\u201d went one recently. Kids steamed past on scooters, ran around in fields, scampered through a forest, all red-cheeked and brazenly healthy. And there is endless craft in the old Blue Peter style \u2013 demonstrations by presenters of how to make a planet out of bits of cardboard.</p> <p>All this is as old as the medium. I saw a Watch with Mother from 1963 the other day, and the presenter \u2013 a beautifully formal lady, with hair like a bold and immovable granite sculpture around her head and an accent that died with the empire \u2013 sat behind a table in front of some floral curtains and spent an unfeasibly long time showing her audience how to make paper lanterns, while being distracted by a wooden puppet dog called Sausage. \u201cThe paper must be the right shape,\u201d she instructed seriously. \u201cAn <em>oblong</em>.\u201d</p> <p>The craft displays and montages of children foraging are all laudable, but they somehow become a form of mockery when confronted with your child\u2019s catatonic passivity as they stare at the screen. When a kid is watching another kid in a forest on TV, they are very obviously not in a forest. And, let\u2019s be honest, no kid is going to watch another kid in a forest and say: \u201cI want to go to a forest.\u201d They\u2019re going to say, \u201cCan I watch another Mike the Knight?\u201d And you, the parent, have turned on the TV precisely to avoid having to go to a forest, or because you have just come back from the playground and are really tired. It\u2019s not that you don\u2019t like forests \u2013 you love them! And on your occasional forest visits you take a lot of pictures to remind yourself that your kid\u2019s childhood is definitely idyllic. But, the point is that watching your child watching another child run through a forest serves only to remind you that right now your own child is doing the exact opposite.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"964aa870adb6112b1159c938af938e5a88d06c33\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/964aa870adb6112b1159c938af938e5a88d06c33/0_143_4239_2543/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Clangers come on at the end of the CBeebies day, narrated by the steady, lulling voice of Michael Palin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Clangers come on at the end of the CBeebies day, narrated by the steady, lulling voice of Michael Palin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Production/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>The end of the day, as declared by CBeebies,</strong> is at 7pm. The channel simply stops, the way channels used to in the distant, analogue past. The \u201cbedtime hour\u201d concludes with a bedtime story, often read by a famous actor \u2013 Damian Lewis, Rosamund Pike, David Hasselhoff \u2013 who seem genuinely delighted about their five minutes of airtime on kids\u2019 TV. The narrating celebrity presence on CBeebies is a constant: Alexander Armstrong (Hey Duggee), Derek Jacobi (In the Night Garden), Lorraine Kelly (Raa-Raa the Noisy Lion). The other day I watched Bing, about a large-eyed, hapless toddler rabbit, and spent the entire episode trying to identify the lyrical voice of his little brown-bear carer called Flop. Finally, the credits rolled: Academy Award-winner Mark Rylance!</p> <p>For some, the bedtime hour is a taunt \u2013 by that time, a kid may only be getting into his stride. For others, it is essential to sanity. When they altered the bedtime hour\u2019s programme line-up last year, the CBeebies schedule manager wrote a long post on the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/grownups\">CBeebies Grown-ups</a> website to gently prepare parents for the transformation. \u201cWe don\u2019t make these changes lightly,\u201d he wrote, nervously. The response was dramatic. \u201cPlease reconsider,\u201d pleaded one commenter. \u201cMy children were hysterical!!!\u201d wrote another.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2007/nov/25/features.magazine47\">Night fever: How In The Night Garden became a TV fairytale</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But in fact, something rather wonderful takes place in this final portion of the day.

This show, <em>this show</em>. First broadcast in 2007, its 100 episodes \u2013 the final series aired in 2009 \u2013 are constantly repeated on CBeebies. And they are bonkers, involving a psychedelic cast of Iggle Piggle and Upsy-Daisy and Makka Pakka and the rest, all bobbling around in a surrealist garden, dancing and hugging, hanging out in a magical gazebo and travelling in their flying vessels, the Ninky Nonk and the Pinky Ponk.</p> <p>In the Night Garden exerts a kind of supernatural force that can soften even the most jaded of adult viewers. My mum, after four kids, eight grandchildren, and a strong history of anti-TV bias, still talks fondly of Iggle Piggle. Rounds of Reddit theories persist about whether the whole show is actually Iggle Piggle\u2019s dreamworld, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/12ltqu/in_the_night_garden_is_all_in_iggle_piggles_mind/\">or if his voyage across the ocean in a boat is analogous to death</a>. At the end of each episode, the characters fall asleep one by one, Iggle Piggle the last to go, drifting away in his boat to a theme tune which is the perfect counterpoint to that of Me Too! \u2013 elegiac, melodic, free from lyrics about shopping. By the end, the kid is watching in a transported state of wonder and joy I used to think only class\u2011A drugs could induce.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"22896c36dc7930c693862af4351ccbcb3d93ae71\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/22896c36dc7930c693862af4351ccbcb3d93ae71/195_0_5846_3508/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sarah &amp; Duck.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sarah &amp; Duck.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karrot Entertainment</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Watching a child watch In the Night Garden makes sense of things a bit. The kid loves TV for precisely the reasons I love TV. Pleasure, relaxation, stories. She falls, just like I do, for characters, for worlds. It is a way of escaping, maybe expanding, or at least releasing yourself to someone else\u2019s imagination for a while. I don\u2019t feel guilty about watching it, so it would be pointlessly hypocritical to feel guilty about her watching it.</p> <p>My favourite show on CBeebies \u2013 words I never thought I\u2019d write \u2013 isn\u2019t In the Night Garden, though. It\u2019s Sarah &amp; Duck, a series of seven-minute animations about a beanie-wearing girl called Sarah and her duck, called Duck. Sarah is busy, a little officious, kind; Duck, puffed up and absurd, always trying to do things beyond his natural limitations as a waterfowl. They go to the park, to the shop, to the zoo. It\u2019s all fairly low-key, except there is usually some otherworldly element \u2013 a friendly moon or a knitted house or a row of talking shallots \u2013 that nudged the limited action on a bit. An episode might involve Sarah having a cold, or Duck pretending to be a penguin. We\u2019re not talking high drama. But it seems, miraculously, to appeal to the kid and me in equal measure. I think, for me at least, it\u2019s the humour \u2013 quietly visual, where a joke might be the way Duck ravishes a slice of bread \u2013 and the way its tone avoids the usual force-feed of bonhomie. Or maybe it\u2019s just the genial narrating voice of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/mar/12/roger-allam-actor-endeavour-portrait\">Roger Allam</a>, who never sounds like he is talking to a child.</p> <p>When I watch a good episode \u2013 Beach Break, for example \u2013 in which Duck attempts to eat a strawberry ice\u2011cream, spills it in the sand, narrows his eyes murderously, and then face-plants in both sand and ice cream to try and salvage its remains, I think of the animators. Their work \u2013 probably spending the best part of a week at a computer manipulating the facial expression of a cartoon duck for the sake of four seconds of my kid\u2019s, sorry, my viewing pleasure \u2013 is nothing short of heroic.

But the PR machine behind one of the city\u2019s most controversial new towers \u2013 who have been firefighting bad press <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/sep/06/walkie-talkie-architect-predicted-reflection-sun-rays\">since the building turned out to be a death-ray-wielding liability</a> \u2013 had made sure the hosts were primed.

It is quite unlike any other panorama in the city: it sits right at the centre of it all, yet strangely out on its own, uncrowded by tall neighbours \u2013 which is the very reason it was so vociferously opposed, for sticking out like a sore pint-shaped thumb.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jan/11/high-shard-view\">The Shard</a> is the first thing you see, bang in the middle of the view in all its splintered glory. At 150m, your eye-line is exactly halfway up the crystal wedge, so you see it in strangely flattened elevation: the one place in the city where it\u2019s not looming above you as the omnipresent spike of Mordor.</p> <p>To the north, as Rees promised, you do look back at the emerging City cluster, with the Cheesegrater, Gherkin and NatWest Tower dutifully lined up like chess pieces in a row. A tiny Canary Wharf blinks to the east, while the Tower of London is laid out below for the first time in brilliant clarity, as if drawn in axonometric. The lights of Tower Bridge look equally impressive \u2013 but this has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jan/04/20-fenchurch-street-walkie-talkie-review-rowan-moore-sky-garden\">come at a cost to the view of the bridge from downriver at Shad Thames</a>, from where the Walkie-Talkie\u2019s sanitary towel silhouette crashes thuggishly into view between the gothic spires.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30d4e9f1313b449b1af1b4b3ab24bcd58b4eb477\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/6/1420558680070/537d719e-60fd-46d5-adcb-71c3718b75cb-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The Walkie-Talkie crashes into view behind Tower Bridge.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Walkie-Talkie crashes into view behind Tower Bridge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In theory, by lumbering into the middle of it all, the Walkie-Talkie provides the best aerial view of London. But the reality is that to appreciate this 360-degree vista, you actually have to look quite hard. For what stands out in the foreground is the great cage of steelwork that flexes in all directions, wrapping 15m above your head in a voluminous arc and plunging down in front of the glass facades. You are invited to behold less the skyline of London than the structural gymnastics of the architect, <a href=\"http://www.rvapc.com/\">Rafael Vi\u00f1oly</a> \u2013 who gives his name to both the exclusive private dining room at the building\u2019s summit and a cocktail on the menu. Which would be fine, perhaps, if this were an elegant Crystal Palace in the clouds. But sadly, the New York-based Uruguayan is no Joseph Paxton. It feels a lot like being in an airport terminal, jacked up in the air.</p> <p>At the centre of the space, flanked by strips of terraced garden, are the <a href=\"http://skygarden.london/\">\u201ccatering concepts\u201d</a> that make the whole thing viable. Stepping up across the three-storey space in what resembles a pile of glass-walled Portakabins, they climb progressively as the prices rise: from the Sky Pod bar, which enjoys the expansive freedom of the lower terrace, to the \u201caccessible\u201d Darwin brasserie, to the \u201crefined dining experience\u201d of the Fenchurch grill at the top. In all, there\u2019s room for 400 diners, plus an extra 200 members of the public, roaming around an area around the size of a football pitch. As rooftops go, it\u2019s a biggun.</p> <p>Sitting at the cheapest lower bar, I ordered a Rhubarb Vi\u00f1oly (\u00a314.50), which was sadly unavailable, so I opted for the Bitter Truth (a snip at \u00a311.50). As I supped on the orange peel-scented serum veritas, looking up at the stack of restaurant capsules, it dawned on me that the more you pay, the worse your view becomes. By the time you\u2019re at the pinnacle of the dining ziggurat, you\u2019re the furthest from the windows, and separated from the vista by several layers of steelwork.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ebf07d6b63c93c88632ff5c9cada34709d3893a\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/6/1420558443442/3904eee8-da8b-418d-b4bd-9d726e8bf67e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The northern terrace \u2026 'more like a hotel lobby than Kew Gardens'\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The northern terrace \u2026 \u2018more like a hotel lobby than Kew Gardens\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oliver Wainwright/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In fact, wherever you are in the sky garden, the views feel frustratingly distant. The city is separated from your gaze by a buffer of external parapets to the north and a smokers\u2019 terrace to the south; nowhere can you put your face to the glass and look right down. The whole of London spreads out below, but you\u2019ll have to crane your neck to see it.</p> <p>My architect drinking companion loved it. \u201cI think it might be the best place I\u2019ve ever been,\u201d he cooed. But then he did used to enjoy hanging out at Stansted airport\u2019s hotel bar in his youth.</p> <p>So what about the much-vaunted garden? The glade of full-height trees, promised in the computer visualisations and used to sell the project to the planners, is mysteriously absent. It has been replaced by a pair of planted slopes dotted with hefty steel watering columns. Designed by landscape practice Gillespies, it is supposed to appear \u201cas if you\u2019re coming across a mountain slope,\u201d a terraced world of ferns and succulents, apparently punctuated by African lilies, red hot pokers and bird of paradise plants.</p> <p>In Rees\u2019s eyes, it is an aerial bower for gossiping. \u201cThe secret of the City\u2019s success is having places to gossip,\u201d he told me, describing the financial capital as \u201ca cluster of beehives on a compost heap.\u201d \u201cThe honey is the gossip,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s how business gets done: the result of the bees rubbing up against each other by chance. So it\u2019s very important for business that people can party as close to their desks as possible. We are taking every opportunity to create the party city in the sky.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ad6c24ac5c7d36ba51d1878b566911852b14da7\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/6/1420558552831/a6ceba4e-063f-4e59-aaf9-e3f58f06702a-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The vision \u2026 how the computer visualisations promised the space would look\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The vision \u2026 how the computer visualisations promised the space would look.

Every building is a prototype, and things have to change as they go along. But it isn\u2019t a garden.\u201d</p> <p>The slopes are nice enough, and include little stepped nooks to gossip furtively, but it all speaks more of swanky hotel lobby than Kew Gardens, whose experts lent their advice. It is less a Sky Garden than a Sky Rockery. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chrismatthew82/status/552258844668461056\">As one Twitter wit put it</a>, responding to a photo online: \u201cImagine it. You\u2019ve climbed to the top of the greasy pole and it\u2019s not even as good as Center Parcs.\u201d</p> <p>That must be how the remaining City planners are feeling now. They were promised a Babylonian hanging gardens, the pride of the square mile, accessible to all.

It is not the public park that was promised, but another private party space, available by appointment.</p> <p>A source close to the planning department is candid: \u201cIt\u2019s still very much a live issue here.

We are sitting in a bare room in his publisher\u2019s offices, in chilly north London. The author and activist has just arrived and is preparing for a week of speaking engagements, but he has been telling me about his garden in Ramallah. \u201cWell, there are several gardens,\u201d he laughs. The one-storey house which he built with his wife is arranged around a courtyard. \u201cIt has a glorious lemon tree in the middle, and then it has beds which I keep always with blooming things and so on, and then a few pots. In front of the house there is a bougainvillea, and there is a garden overlooking our living room which has easy things \u2013 roses and plumbago. And I also plant vegetables, I plant potatoes, peas and broad beans and spring onions.\u201d His face creases with delight as he tells me all this in his delicate Arabic accent, getting carried away and, indeed, giving a good picture.</p> <p>It is one that stands in contrast to the usual idea of daily life in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/series/west-bank-settlements\">West Bank</a>. But it would be a mistake to imagine that politics doesn\u2019t cast a shadow over this garden, like everything else. Shehadeh, whose family were forced to abandon their home in Jaffa in 1948, and who has spent much of his life railing against the fragmentation and defilement of Palestinian land, explains: \u201cNobody can deprive us of the inner courtyard, it\u2019s ours. Nothing can be done to spoil it. We see the sky and we see the moon. We have part of the sky and a little bit of land, and that\u2019s our world.\u201d</p> <p>It feels safe. It is, for the moment \u2013 standing solid in a part of the Occupied Territories controlled by the Palestinian Authority. But you could forgive Shehadeh for entertaining a sliver of doubt, even within his four walls. A sense of insecurity has dogged him throughout his life. \u201cI was born at the worst time possible,\u201d he tells me. It was 1951, three years after the family\u2019s exile from their hometown. \u201cMy father had lost everything. It was materially very difficult. And he took on the case of the murder of King Abdullah.\u201d Aziz Shehadeh, a prominent lawyer, defended a Palestinian accused of assassinating the Jordanian leader as he prepared to meet Israeli officials in Jerusalem. \u201cHe was exiled, he was imprisoned, these were tense times. All this affected me.\u201d</p> <p>Raja grew up a sickly child, debilitated by lactose intolerance, the effects of which his family innocently treated with nourishing doses of milk and creamy dishes. He fell prey to a series of infections, including diphtheria, and played, when he was well, alone. Though he wasn\u2019t \u201csportish\u201d, he liked being outside, and seems to have had a Gerald Durrell-like appreciation for things that crawled and crept. \u201cI would follow the ants on the floor and look at things. I loved butterflies. All summer long, I would be out in the fields and the hills. If I went a little way I would consider it a big adventure.\u201d<br></p> <p>When he got tired, or became ill, the doors to adventure were not completely closed: there were poems and books. He writes in English, and grew up speaking and reading it, but I wonder about his relationship with Arabic, the language that surrounds him when he ventures outside his courtyard. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with Arabic, it lends itself to beautiful writing,\u201d he says. But early on he was taught to associate English with creativity and experimentation. \u201cIn Arabic there is wonderful, very complex poetry and we studied it to admire it, you know, to be awed by it. And we were so awed by it that I was sure that one is either born a poet or not, and there is no in-between. And so when our teacher of English said, \u201cOk, today I want you to all write a poem\u201d, I was shocked, I thought: but we were not born poets, how can we do that? And he encouraged us, and I found that I could write a poem, and I started writing many poems, in English!\u201d</p> <p>When he became a man, this bookish child followed his father into the law. Words became his mode of action. In particular, he was determined to record and challenge Israeli military orders and expropriations of land. In 1979 he helped found Al-Haq, one of the first human rights pressure groups in the Arab world. A tumultuous period followed. His relationship with his father, later the subject of a memoir, <em>Strangers in the House</em>, had become troubled and complex. Any hope of resolving it was shattered by Aziz\u2019s murder in 1985. The perpetrator was a Palestinian against whose family he had brought a property case, but the Israeli authorities suggested the killing was politically motivated. It was years before the truth emerged. In the midst of all that came the first intifada, and Al-Haq\u2019s activities ratcheted up, expanding to cover the Gaza strip. After an exhausting and intense period of activism, Shehadeh\u2019s legal career culminated in a disastrous engagement with the Oslo process, during which the Palestinian leadership decided to ignore his work on military orders. Disillusionment and anger followed.</p> <p>But despite these experiences, he is still proud to call himself a lawyer, and maintains that law is an effective means of self-defence. His latest book, <em>Language of War, Language of Peace</em>,<em> </em>can be seen as part of a lifelong mission to reveal the legal narrative that delimits Palestinian lives. From the outside it is easy to be sceptical. After all, since the foundation of Al-Haq, the situation on the ground has hardly improved. Other forms of resistance may be unconscionable, but attempts to seek redress through the courts can sometimes give the impression of an aircraft in a holding pattern, plaintiffs expending fuel without moving forward. This week <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2015/apr/01/palestinian-authority-becomes-member-of-international-criminal-court\">Palestine joined the International Criminal Court</a>, though Israel is unlikely to cooperate with any ICC investigations. Shehadeh, for his part, believes that membership will deter human rights abuses. His faith in legal processes is partly a question of temperament. \u201cI always felt that the worst thing that could happen is confusion. I fear confusion and mysteries. Even if I\u2019m not going to prevail, I want to be clear where I stand.\u201d This fastidiousness is married to an optimism which seems, in the circumstances, almost utopian: \u201cI continue to be a believer in the rule of law and in international law. I think that one of the great victories of humankind was the creation of a law that prevails even during war. Now, it doesn\u2019t always prevail, it\u2019s violated, but it\u2019s important to keep trying.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/aug/23/israel.politicsphilosophyandsociety\">Ian Black reviews the memoirs of Palestinian lawyer and writer Rajah Shehadeh</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In another world, Shehadeh would have been a jobbing commercial lawyer and a nature writer on the side. And that is almost what he has become. His joy in the countryside, in the terraces of olive trees, the plants and animals, is obvious. But like his house, his writing has been shaped by the extraordinary place in which he lives. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/apr/25/news.awardsandprizes\"><em>Palestinian Walks</em>, which won the Orwell prize in 2008</a>, is an unsettling hybrid: part gentle travelogue, part forensic documentation of the indignities suffered by Palestinians as they go about their daily lives. There is the sense of a poet who would like simply to contemplate the flowers if only he were allowed to \u2013 but what should be idyllic is constantly interrupted by the mess human beings have made. Illegal blocks of flats sprout on the hillsides, ruining views; religious rows break out between groups of picnickers; the army is called in by suspicious settlers to scrutinise photos of bees and blossoms taken by a hiking companion. The shrinking freedom to simply walk, in the face of harassment and threats to personal safety, is grasped somewhat desperately. But Shehadeh knows that if it is not exercised, even this modest right could disappear.</p> <p>And he\u2019ll be damned if this pleasure, unthinkingly enjoyed elsewhere in the world, is to be denied him simply because he is Palestinian. Though his usual demeanour is that of the softly spoken intellectual, a natural successor to that vulnerable, introverted child, there are flashes of searing anger, justified by the fate of his family, his friends and compatriots. Not only the seismic shocks, such as the exile from Jaffa or the murder of his father. He relates with fresh indignation how soldiers were billeted with his younger brother during the military incursion in Ramallah in 2002. The family was confined to a single room, denied permission even to use their own toilet.</p> <p>Shehadeh and his American wife, Penny, who came to spend a year at Birzeit University in the 1980s and ended up staying, don\u2019t have children. \u201cI would have worried too much and I would not have been able to allow the child to be, which is what you need to do.\u201d Although he believes children are resilient, he fears the impact of house searches and checkpoints on young minds. In <em>Language of War, Language of Peace</em>, he quotes Gazan psychiatrist Eyad el-Sarraj: \u201cDuring the first intifada, studies showed that 55% of the children had witnessed their fathers being humiliated or beaten by Israeli soldiers. The psychological impact of this is stunning. Children who have seen so much inhumanity \u2026 inevitably come out with inhuman responses.\u201d</p> <p>Listening to Shehadeh, and reading his diary entries and memoirs, I am reminded of the fact that every geopolitical story is also the story of families, and individuals. Each mention of an armistice or occupation hides within it the tortured histories of this or that grandmother, niece, nephew, brother or sister. It is also the story of how personhood is forged, how internal and external worlds collide to influence the course of a life. For Shehadeh, the occupation he lives under has proved a sort of double bind. He is tortured by anger at the constant setbacks, but forced by his own capacity for hope to keep faith that progress can be made. I ask whether he has ever considered decisively changing his own story: emigrating, like the friends in <em>Palestinian Walks</em> who moved to Australia and \u201cfound that they no longer bothered even to read the newspapers to learn what was happening here\u201d.</p> <p>Yes, he tells me, there have been a couple of times. During the first intifada, \u201cI began to get so angry and was beginning to worry about getting out of control\u201d. And again, after Oslo, with everything that he had worked for apparently in tatters. \u201cBut then I realised very soon that it is not an option. If I leave, my thoughts are about what\u2019s going on there. You can\u2019t really leave.\u201d He laughs and pauses. \u201cIt\u2019s also not all heroic. Because it\u2019s a very nice place to live, despite everything.\u201d</p> <p>Shehadeh has made his accommodation with the facts. He looks out at the beleaguered world around him, but returns to his inner sanctum to draw strength. And as I type this, he sends me an email. \u201cIt is a glorious spring this year in Palestine and my garden is doing especially well.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 Language of War, Language of Peace</em> is published by Profile.</p>", "wordcount": "1884"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}, {"id": "football/live/2015/mar/10/real-madrid-v-schalke-champions-league-live", "type": "liveblog", "sectionId": "football", "sectionName": "Football", "webPublicationDate": "2015-03-10T21:41:43Z", "webTitle": "Real Madrid v Schalke: Champions League \u2013 as it happened", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2015/mar/10/real-madrid-v-schalke-champions-league-live", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2015/mar/10/real-madrid-v-schalke-champions-league-live", "fields": {"byline": "Scott Murray", "body": "<div id=\"block-54ff638fe4b0115cd1c705e0\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-03-10T21:36:24.506Z\">9.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">FULL TIME: Real Madrid 3-4 Schalke (agg 5-4)</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The holders are through.

Still, they can strut home with their heads held high, and once the pain subsides, can - no, <em>will</em> - look back with pride at one of the great European performances: the evening Schalke nearly closed down the BBC.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCX--Mo7NDM\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NCX--Mo7NDM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-03-10T21:42:54.153Z\">at 9.42pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-54ff6360e4b0fa8c28d58bec\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-03-10T21:35:10.288Z\">9.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>90 min: +3:</strong> ...

To Brentford\u2019s credit though they did find room for Stan Bowles up front.\u201d Times change, of course, but I wonder what Hurlock, Kamara and Harris would have said, had someone like current Bees owner and data analyst Matthew Benham told them their Key Performance Indicators weren\u2019t up to scratch?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a65cbfb9538ccf6a261ee09d7f13f997f3c25c3f\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/10/1426023319959/f52eab0a-ef29-4fd4-a9b1-f83610a3d6fb-460x308.jpeg\" alt=\"Isco has a shot.\" width=\"460\" height=\"308\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Isco has a shot.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ruben Albarran/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-03-10T21:35:23.995Z\">at 9.35pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-54ff589be4b0fa8c28d58bdb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-03-10T20:50:45.382Z\">8.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>48 min: </strong>Schalke appear to be continuing as they left off.

At that point in history, they had one more domestic title than Real Madrid: seven to six. Real now have 32 of the things. And of course ten European Cup wins to Schalke\u2019s big fat zero. There\u2019s no doubt who the big boys are now. Though Schalke do have one Uefa Cup to their name, which they won at Roy Hodgson\u2019s expense in 1997.</p> <p><strong>But perhaps of more relevance are the three times these two great institutions have met in competitive football.</strong> It\u2019s all been happening during the last 12 months, and none of it has been good news for Schalke. In last season\u2019s Round of Arsenal, Real won 6-1 in Gelsenkirchen and then 3-1 at the Bernabeu. Then a couple of weeks ago, in the first leg of this year\u2019s RoA, Real recorded an easy 2-0 victory in Gelsenkirchen, Ronaldo and Marcelo the scorers.
